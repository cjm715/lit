\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
An incompressible flow can be an effective mixer of a dye by appropriately advecting the dye to produce small filamentation length scales. It is known that the Batchelor length scale [\cite{Batchelor1959a}] is the theorized lower limit of dye length scales  achievable under turbulent flows. We provide numerical evidence that this limitation may be more general and applies to incompressible flows under mild physical constraints such as fixed enstrophy and energy. We consider local-in-time flow optimization under these constraints with the objective of maximizing mixing rate performance. For enstrophy-bounded optimal flows, we find that the strength of diffusion has no impact on the long-term mixing rate performance. For energy-constrained optimal flows, we find that an increase in the strength of diffusion worsens this performance. We provide analytical lower bounds on mixing rates and length scales achievable under related constraints (pointwise bounded speed and rate-of-strain) by extending the work of \cite{JFM2011} and \cite{Chi-Cheu1996}.

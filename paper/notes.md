###### Key notes on guidlines
- give each figure file a name which indicates the number of the figure it contains; for example, figure1.eps, figure2a.eps, etc. If the figure file contains a figure with multiple parts, for example figure 2(a) to 2(e), give it a name such as figure2a_2e.eps, and so forth.
- Please name all your files, both figures and text, as follows:
    - Use only characters from the set a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9 and underscore ( ). â€¢ Do not use spaces or punctuation characters in file names.
    - Do not use any accented characters
    - Include an extension to indicate the file type (e.g., .tex, .eps, .txt, etc).
- UK spelling is required
- \NL is the macro name for Nonlinearity
- MSC classification may be used as well as PACS
- Use EPS format for images.
- Do not title a figure.
- Use 150 - 300 dpi for images
- color is free in online publication.


###### Audience
Note the following description from the publisher's website:

> Published jointly with the London Mathematical Society, Nonlinearity covers the interdisciplinary nature of nonlinear science, featuring topics which range from physics, mathematics and engineering through to biological sciences.

Thus, the target audience is interdisciplinary and concerned with nonlinearity.

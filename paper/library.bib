abstract = {We address the challenge of optimal incompressible stirring to mix an initially inhomogeneous distribution of passive tracers. As a quantitative measure of mixing we adopt the {\$}H{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} norm of the scalar fluctuation field, equivalent to the (square-root of the) variance of a low-pass filtered image of the tracer concentration field. First we establish that this is a useful gauge even in the absence of molecular diffusion: its vanishing as {\$}t --{\textgreater} \backslashinfty{\$} is evidence of the stirring flow's mixing properties in the sense of ergodic theory. Then we derive absolute limits on the total amount of mixing, as a function of time, on a periodic spatial domain with a prescribed instantaneous stirring energy or stirring power budget. We subsequently determine the flow field that instantaneously maximizes the decay of this mixing measure---when such a flow exists. When no such `steepest descent' flow exists (a possible but non-generic situation) we determine the flow that maximizes the growth rate of the {\$}H{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} norm's decay rate. This local-in-time optimal stirring strategy is implemented numerically on a benchmark problem and compared to an optimal control approach using a restricted set of flows. Some significant challenges for analysis are outlined.},

abstract = {CH $\alpha$ residual dipolar couplings ($\Delta$rdc's) were measured for the oxidized cytochrome b 562 from Escherichia coli as a result of its partial self-orientation in high magnetic fields due to the anisotropy of the overall magnetic susceptibility tensor. Both the low spin iron (III) heme and the four-helix bundle fold contribute to the magnetic anisotropy tensor. CH $\alpha$ $\Delta$rdc's, which span a larger range than the analogous NH values (already available in the literature) sample large space variations at variance with NH $\Delta$rdc's, which are largely isooriented within $\alpha$ helices. The whole structure is now significantly refined with the chemical shift index and CH $\alpha$ $\Delta$rdc's. The latter are particularly useful also in defining the molecular magnetic anisotropy parameters. It is shown here that the backbone folding can be conveniently and accurately determined using backbone restraints only, which include NOEs, hydrogen bonds, residual dipolar couplings, pseudocontact shifts, and chemical shift index. All these restraints are easily and quickly determined from the backbone assignment. The calculated backbone structure is comparable to that obtained by using also side chain restraint. Furthermore, the structure obtained with backbone only restraints is, in its whole, very similar to that obtained with the complete set of restraints. The paramagnetism based restraints are shown to be absolutely relevant, especially for $\Delta$rdc's. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This result, together with the proof of energy conservation for {\$}\backslashalpha {\textgreater} 1/3{\$} due to [Eyink] and [Constantin, E, Titi], solves Onsager's conjecture that the exponent {\$}\backslashalpha = 1/3{\$} marks the threshold for conservation of energy for weak solutions in the class {\$}L{\_}t{\^{}}\backslashinfty C{\_}x{\^{}}\backslashalpha{\$}. The previous best results were solutions in the class {\$}C{\_}tC{\_}x{\^{}}\backslashalpha{\$} for {\$}\backslashalpha {\textless} 1/5{\$}, due to the author, and in the class {\$}L{\_}t{\^{}}1 C{\_}x{\^{}}\backslashalpha{\$} for {\$}\backslashalpha {\textless} 1/3{\$} due to Buckmaster, De Lellis and Sz$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}kelyhidi, both based on the method of convex integration developed for the incompressible Euler equations by De Lellis and Sz$\backslash$'ekelyhidi. The present proof combines the method of convex integration and a new "gluing approximation" technique. The convex integration part of the proof relies on the "Mikado flows" introduced by [Daneri, Sz$\backslash$'ekelyhidi] and the framework of estimates developed in the author's previous work.},

@article{Sanchez2012,
abstract = {With remarkable precision and reproducibility, cells orchestrate the cooperative action of thousands of nanometre-sized molecular motors to carry out mechanical tasks at much larger length scales, such as cell motility, division and replication. Besides their biological importance, such inherently non-equilibrium processes suggest approaches for developing biomimetic active materials from microscopic components that consume energy to generate continuous motion. Being actively driven, these materials are not constrained by the laws of equilibrium statistical mechanics and can thus exhibit sought-after properties such as autonomous motility, internally generated flows and self-organized beating. Here, starting from extensile microtubule bundles, we hierarchically assemble far-from-equilibrium analogues of conventional polymer gels, liquid crystals and emulsions. At high enough concentration, the microtubules form a percolating active network characterized by internally driven chaotic flows, hydrodynamic instabilities, enhanced transport and fluid mixing. When confined to emulsion droplets, three-dimensional networks spontaneously adsorb onto the droplet surfaces to produce highly active two-dimensional nematic liquid crystals whose streaming flows are controlled by internally generated fractures and self-healing, as well as unbinding and annihilation of oppositely charged disclination defects. The resulting active emulsions exhibit unexpected properties, such as autonomous motility, which are not observed in their passive analogues. Taken together, these observations exemplify how assemblages of animate microscopic objects exhibit collective biomimetic properties that are very different from those found in materials assembled from inanimate building blocks, challenging us to develop a theoretical framework that would allow for a systematic engineering of their far-from-equilibrium material properties.},

abstract = {By its very nature, the second law of thermodynamics is probabilistic, in that its formulation requires a probabilistic description of the state of a system. This raises questions about the objectivity of the second law: does it depend, for example, on what we know about the system? For over a century, much effort has been devoted to incorporating information into thermodynamics and assessing the entropic and energetic costs of manipulating information. More recently, this historically theoretical pursuit has become relevant in practical situations where information is manipulated at small scales, such as in molecular and cell biology, artificial nano-devices or quantum computation. Here we give an introduction to a novel theoretical framework for the thermodynamics of information based on stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems, review some recent experimental results, and present an overview of the state of the art in the field.},

abstract = {Transition from laminar to turbulent flow drastically changes the mixing, transport, and drag properties of fluids, yet when and how turbulence emerges is elusive even for simple flow within pipes and rectangular channels. Unlike the onset of temporal disorder, which is identified as the universal route to chaos in confined flows, characterization of the onset of spatio-temporal disorder has been an outstanding challenge because turbulent domains irregularly decay or spread as they propagate downstream. Here, through extensive experimental investigation of channel flow, we identify a distinctive transition with critical behavior. Turbulent domains continuously injected from an inlet ultimately decayed, or in contrast, spread depending on flow rates. Near a transition point, critical behavior was observed. We investigate both spatial and temporal dynamics of turbulent clusters, measuring four critical exponents, a universal scaling function and a scaling relation, all in agreement with the (2+1)-dimensional directed percolation universality class.},

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57{\%}, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

The result is used to place an upper bound on the tension that can be generated during cytokinesis.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The scalar field is studied by visualization, and the rampcliff structure and the mesacanyon structure are observed along the directions parallel and perpendicular to the mean scalar gradient, respectively. The probability density function of the scalar flux is theoretically computed and found to be in good agreement with the numerical results. A Lagrangian statistical theory for the scalar flux is developed, which predicts that the scalar transfer flux is given by the time integral of the Lagrangian velocity autocorrelation and increases in proportion to the P{\'{e}}clet number, which is consistent with the results of the direct numerical simulation. A physical explanation of the asymmetry of the scalar flux PDF is explored. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recently the second and fourth authors developed an iterative scheme for obtaining rough solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations in H{\"{o}}lder spaces. The motivation comes from Onsager's conjecture. The con-struction involves a superposition of weakly interacting perturbed Beltrami flows on infinitely many scales. An obstruction to better regularity arises from the errors in the linear transport of a fast periodic flow by a slow velocity field. In a recent paper the third author has improved upon the methods, in-troducing some novel ideas on how to deal with this obstruction, thereby reaching a better H{\"{o}}lder exponent — albeit weaker than the one conjec-tured by Onsager. In this paper we give a shorter proof of this final result, adhering more to the original scheme of the second and fourth authors and introducing some new devices. More precisely we show that for any positive $\epsilon$, there exist periodic solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations that dissipate the total kinetic energy and belong to the H{\"{o}}lder class C 1/5−$\epsilon$ .},

abstract = {Suspensions of self-propelled particles, such as swimming micro-organisms, are known to undergo complex dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic interactions. To elucidate these dynamics, a kinetic theory is developed and applied to study the linear stability and the nonlinear pattern formation in these systems. The evolution of a suspension of self-propelled particles is modeled using a conservation equation for the particle configurations, coupled to a mean-field description of the flow arising from the stress exerted by the particles on the fluid. Based on this model, we first investigate the stability of both aligned and isotropic suspensions. In aligned suspensions, an instability is shown to always occur at finite wavelengths, a result that extends previous predictions by Simha and Ramaswamy [“Hydrodynamic fluctuations and instabilities in ordered suspensions of self-propelled particles,” Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 058101 (2002) ]. In isotropic suspensions, we demonstrate the existence of an instability for the active particle stress, in which shear stresses are eigenmodes and grow exponentially at long scales. Nonlinear effects are also investigated using numerical simulations in two dimensions. These simulations confirm the results of the stability analysis, and the long-time nonlinear behavior is shown to be characterized by the formation of strong density fluctuations, which merge and breakup in time in a quasiperiodic fashion. These complex motions result in very efficient fluid mixing, which we quantify by means of a multiscale mixing norm.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, active control has been investigated in combustion systems as a means of preventing thermoacoustic instabilities from degrading the system performance. More recently, attempts to control instability and emissions as well as to satisfy other performance criteria have also been pursued. In this article, the authors review control problems in continuous combustion processes, the need for active control, and current status of the field. Despite the success reported in experimental investigations, a systematic procedure by which active control can be designed and implemented is currently not available. In particular, a theoretical framework which includes an investigation of the resonant nature of the thermoacoustic instability, an understanding of the significance of the mixing of modes and the dynamic impact of acoustic drivers, and the incorporation of the subtle coupling among the different physical processes of heat, mass, and momentum addition, as well as acoustics, turbulence, and chemistry, has not been developed. As an example of what can be accomplished using such a theoretically based approach, in this article the authors also review the results of their efforts expended thus far in the area of active control of a premixed combustor. The authors discuss the highlights of a feedback model proposed in Annaswamy et al. (1995) which captures the dominant dynamic features of the combustor. The authors demonstrate that their model captures the effects of several interacting modes, the mean-flow and mean-heat release in the combustor, and the locations of the actuator-sensor pair, and provides guidelines for an active control design. The authors suggest a systematic procedure for designing an active controller that provides an appropriate compensating action and results in improved performance},

From how science is funded, to improving how children are educated -- and nearly everything in-between -- our society has become obsessed with a seductive illusion: that greatness results from doggedly measuring improvement in the relentless pursuit of an ambitious goal. In Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned, Stanley and Lehman begin with a surprising scientific discovery in artificial intelligence that leads ultimately to the conclusion that the objective obsession has gone too far. They make the case that great achievement can't be bottled up into mechanical metrics; that innovation is not driven by narrowly focused heroic effort; and that we would be wiser (and the outcomes better) if instead we whole-heartedly embraced serendipitous discovery and playful creativity. Controversial at its heart, yet refreshingly provocative, this book challenges readers to consider life without a destination and discovery without a compass.},

This transition is embodied in a short superexponential phase of decay. The asymptotic state in the exponential phase is an eigenfunction of the advection-diffusion operator, in which most of the scalar variance is concentrated at small scales, even though a large-scale mode sets the decay rate. The duration of the superexponential phase is proportional to the logarithm of the exponential decay rate; if the decay is slow enough then there is no superexponential phase at all.},

abstract = {We present a model for the actin contractile ring of adherent animal cells. The model suggests that the actin concentration within the ring and consequently the power that the ring exerts both increase during contraction. We demonstrate the crucial role of actin polymerization and depolymerization throughout cytokinesis, and the dominance of viscous dissipation in the dynamics. The physical origin of two phases in cytokinesis dynamics ("biphasic cytokinesis") follows from a limitation on the actin density. The model is consistent with a wide range of measurements of the midzone of dividing animal cells.},

@article{Aref1984a,
abstract = {n the Lagrangian representation, the problem of advection of a passive marker particle by a prescribed flow defines a dynamical system. For two-dimensional incompressible flow this system is Hamiltonian and has just one degree of freedom. For unsteady flow the system is non-autonomous and one must in general expect to observe chaotic particle motion. These ideas are developed and subsequently corroborated through the study of a very simple model which provides an idealization of a stirred tank. In the model the fluid is assumed incompressible and inviscid and its motion wholly two-dimensional. The agitator is modelled as a point vortex, which, together with its image(s) in the bounding contour, provides a source of unsteady potential flow. The motion of a particle in this model device is computed numerically. It is shown that the deciding factor for integrable or chaotic particle motion is the nature of the motion of the agitator. With the agitator held at a fixed position, integrable marker motion ensues, and the model device does not stir very efficiently. If, on the other hand, the agitator is moved in such a way that the potential flow is unsteady, chaotic marker motion can be produced. This leads to efficient stirring. A certain case of the general model, for which the differential equations can be integrated for a finite time to produce an explicitly given, invertible, area-preserving mapping, is used for the calculations. The paper contains discussion of several issues that put this regime of chaotic advection in perspective relative to both the subject of turbulent advection and to recent work on critical points in the advection patterns of steady laminar flows. Extensions of the model, and the notion of chaotic advection, to more realistic flow situations are commented upon.},

abstract = {To improve upon the mixing performance of the Kenics mixer, variations on the standard mixer geometry are investigated using techniques from dynamical systems analysis, including Poincare sections, tracking of fluid tracers, and the development of stretching histories for tracer elements. A more traditional mixing measure, the variation coefficient, is also computed. Three geometric parameters are investigated: the twist direction of adjacent elements, the element length to diameter ratio, and the amount of twist per element. The flow in a mixer with the standard configuration where elements have alternating twist direction is globally chaotic; the flow in a mixer where all elements have the same twist direction displays large segregated regular regions which act as a barrier to uniform mixing and make the latter configuration undesirable for most mixing applications. Extent of mixing per element and energy efficiency are independent of element length to diameter ratio, allowing shorter elements to be used advantageously to obtain equivalent mixing in a smaller space or shorter residence time. A substantial increase in mixer efficiency is achieved using elements with less twist than the standard 180??Kenics configuration.},

By variational principles, we then derive optimality conditions for an optimal flow that minimizes the cost functional and then enhances the mixing. These optimality conditions are represented by a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. Using an iteration method and the finite element method, the system is solved and the numerical result shows that the numerical optimal flow obtained from solving the system gives the minimum of the cost functional and then enhances the mixing},

abstract = {The vaporization of a superheated droplet emulsion into gas bubbles using ultrasound--termed acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV)--has potential therapeutic applications in embolotherapy and drug delivery. The optimization of ADV for therapeutic applications can be enhanced by understanding the physical mechanisms underlying ADV, which are currently not clearly elucidated. Acoustic cavitation is one possible mechanism. This paper investigates the relationship between ADV and inertial cavitation (IC) thresholds (measured as peak rarefactional pressures) by studying parameters that are known to influence the IC threshold. These parameters include bulk fluid properties such as gas saturation, temperature, viscosity, and surface tension; droplet parameters such as degree of superheat, surfactant type, and size; and acoustic properties such as pulse repetition frequency and pulse width. In all cases the ADV threshold occurred at a lower rarefactional pressure than the IC threshold, indicating that the phase transition occurs before IC events. The viscosity and temperature of the bulk fluid are shown to influence both thresholds directly and inversely, respectively. An inverse trend is observed between threshold and diameter for droplets in the 1 to 2.5 microm range. Based on a choice of experimental parameters, it is possible to achieve ADV with or without IC.},

abstract = {The ability to localize, both spatially and temporally, a chemotherapeutic agent could be used to reduce the systemic toxicity associated with conventional chemotherapy regimens. Ultrasound (US)-triggered drug delivery systems, such as microbubbles or emulsions, present the ability to localize the effect of chemotherapy agents. In the case of phase-shift emulsions, the activation by US results in the production of gas bubbles - a process known as acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV). Here, the ability of ADV to selectively release chlorambucil (CHL), a clinically-used chemotherapeutic agent, from an emulsion is tested in vitro. A micron-sized emulsion, stabilized by bovine serum albumin, was made using perfluoropentane, soybean oil, and CHL. A linear array (6.3 MHz, mechanical index = 0.7) was used to vaporize the CHL-laden emulsion after introduction into chambers containing adherent Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. An 84.3±3.8{\%} growth inhibition was observed with ultrasound, compared to 46.7±7.6{\%} growth inhibition without ultrasound. Therefore, ADV has the potential to localize the release of an agent encapsulated within the triggered emulsion.},

abstract = {Evolution is one of the major omnipresent powers in the universe that has been studied for about two centuries. Recent scientific and technical developments make it possible to make the transition from passively understanding to actively mastering evolution. As of today, the only area where human experimenters can design and manipulate evolutionary processes in full is that of Evolutionary Computing, where evolutionary processes are carried out in a digital space, inside computers, in simulation. We argue that in the near future it will be possible to move evolutionary computing outside such imaginary spaces and make it physically embodied. In other words, we envision the "Evolution of Things", rather than just the evolution of code, leading to a new field of Embodied Artificial Evolution (EAE). The main objective of the present paper is to offer an umbrella term and vision in order to aid the development of this high potential research area. To this end, we introduce the notion of EAE, discuss a few examples and applications, and elaborate on the expected benefits as well as the grand challenges this developing field will have to address.},

abstract = {The time evolution of a passive scalar advected by parallel shear flows is studied for a class of rapidly varying initial data Such situations are of practical importance in a wide range of applications from microfluidics to geophysics In these contexts, it is well-known that the long-time evolution of the tracer concentration is governed by Taylor's asymptotic theory of dispersion In contrast, we focus here on the evolution of the tracer at intermediate time scales We show how intermediate regimes can be identified before Taylor's, and in particular, how the Taylor regime can be delayed indefinitely by properly manufactured initial data A complete characterization of the sorting of these time scales and their associated spatial structures is presented These analytical predictions are compared with highly resolved numerical simulations Specifically, this comparison is carried out for the case of periodic variations in the streamwise direction on the short scale with envelope modulations on the long scales, and show how this structure can lead to "anomalously" diffusive transients in the evolution of the scalar onto the ultimate regime governed by Taylor dispersion Mathematically, the occurrence of these transients can be viewed as a competition in the asymptotic dominance between large Peclet (Pe) numbers and the long/short scale aspect ratios (L(Vel)/L(Tracer) equivalent to k), two independent nondimensional parameters of the problem We provide analytical predictions of the associated time scales by a modal analysis of the eigenvalue problem arising in the separation of variables of the governing advection-diffusion equation The anomalous time scale in the asymptotic limit of large k Pe is derived for the short scale periodic structure of the scalar s initial data, for both exactly solvable cases and in general with WKBJ analysis In particular, the exactly solvable sawtooth flow is especially important in that it provides a short cut to the exact solution to the eigenvalue problem for the physically relevant vanishing Neumann boundary conditions in linear-shear channel flow We show that the life of the corresponding modes at large Pe for this case is shorter than the ones arising from shear free zones in the fluid's interior A WKBJ study of the latter modes provides a longer intermediate time evolution This part of the analysis is technical, as the corresponding spectrum is dominated by asymptotically coalescing turning points in the limit of large Pe numbers When large scale initial data components are present, the transient regime of the WKBJ (anomalous) modes evolves into one governed by Taylor dispersion This is studied by a regular perturbation expansion of the spectrum in the small wavenumber regimes (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics [doi 10 1063/1 3491181]},

Developing a tweezer with a trapping radius large compared with the swimmers' size and run length has been an experimental challenge, as standard optical traps are too weak. Here we report the novel use of an acoustic tweezer to confine self-propelled particles in two dimensions over distances large compared with the swimmers' run length. We develop a near-harmonic trap to demonstrate the crossover from weak confinement, where the probability density is Boltzmann-like, to strong confinement, where the density is peaked along the perimeter. At high concentrations the swimmers crystallize into a close-packed structure, which subsequently 'explodes' as a travelling wave when the tweezer is turned off. The swimmers' confined motion provides a measurement of the swim pressure, a unique mechanical pressure exerted by self-propelled bodies.},

Optimal control enables efficient optimization of NMR experiments in terms of amplitudes, phases, offsets etc. for hundreds-to-thousands of pulses to fully exploit the experimentally available high degree of freedom in pulse sequences to combat variations/limitations in experimental or spin system parameters or design experiments with specific properties typically not covered as easily by standard design procedures. This facilitates straightforward optimization of experiments under consideration of rf and static field inhomogeneities, limitations in available or desired rf field strengths (e.g., for reduction of sample heating), spread in resonance offsets or coupling parameters, variations in spin systems etc. to meet the actual experimental conditions as close as possible. The paper provides a brief account on the relevant theory and in particular the computational interface relevant for optimization of state-to-state transfer (on the density operator level) and the effective Hamiltonian on the level of propagators along with several representative examples within liquid- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The evolution of scalar fields, of different initial integral length scales, in statistically stationary, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence is studied. The initial scalar fields conform, approximately, to ‘‘double‐delta function'' probability density functions (pdf 's). The initial scalar‐to‐velocity integral length‐scale ratio is found to influence the rate of the subsequent evolution of the scalar fields, in accord with experimental observations of Warhaft and Lumley [J. Fluid Mech. 8 8, 659 (1978)]. On the other hand, the pdf of the scalar is found to evolve in a similar fashion for all the scalar fields studied; and, as expected, it tends to a Gaussian. The pdf of the logarithm of the scalar‐dissipation rate reaches an approximately Gaussian self‐similar state. The scalar‐dissipation spectrum function also becomes self‐similar. The evolution of the conditional scalar‐dissipation rate is also studied. The consequences of these results for closure models for the scalar pdf equation are discussed.},

The thermodynamic theory of such structures is outlined. A microscopic definition of irreversible processes is given, and a transformation theory is developed that allows one to introduce nonunitary equations of motion that explicitly display irreversibility and approach to thermodynamic equilibrium. The work of the group at the University of Brussels in these fields is briefly reviewed. In this new development of theoretical chemistry and physics, it is likely that thermodynamic concepts will play an ever-increasing role.},

@article{Dennett2001,
abstract = {Theorists are converging from quite different quarters on a version of the global neuronal workspace model of consciousness, but there are residual confusions to be dissolved. In particular, theorists must resist the temptation to see global accessibility as the cause of consciousness (as if consciousness were some other, further condition); rather, it is consciousness. A useful metaphor for keeping this elusive idea in focus is that consciousness is rather like fame in the brain. It is not a privileged medium of representation, or an added property some states have; it is the very mutual accessibility that gives some informational states the powers that come with a subject's consciousness of that information. Like fame, consciousness is not a momentary condition, or a purely dispositional state, but rather a matter of actual influence over time. Theorists who take on the task of accounting for the aftermath that is critical for consciousness often appear to be leaving out the Subject of consciousness, when in fact they are providing an analysis of the Subject, a necessary component in any serious theory of consciousness.

We study the spatiotemporal patterns that emerge when an active nematic film of microtubules and molecular motors is encapsulated within a shape-changing lipid vesicle. Unlike in equilibrium systems, where defects are largely static structures, in active nematics defects move spontaneously and can be described as self-propelled particles. The combination of activity, topological constraints and vesicle deformability produces a myriad of dynamical states. We highlight two dynamical modes: a tunable periodic state that oscillates between two defect configurations, and shape-changing vesicles with streaming filopodia-like protrusions. These results demonstrate how biomimetic materials can be obtained when topological constraints are used to control the non-equilibrium dynamics of active matter.},

abstract = {Phase-change emulsions (PCE) are important in a variety of applications, from ultrasound imaging to the explosive material used in the mining industry, but until now there has been no adequate theory to describe their activation properties. The PCE consists of a low-boiling-point liquid, known as the volatile phase, dispersed in an aqueous phase. The volatile phase boils as a result of an increase in the temperature of the emulsion. The volume of the emulsion will increase during this phase transition, with the transition temperature and final volume of the emulsion highly dependent on the initial radius of the liquid droplets. Here a description of the change in boiling point and freezing point of the volatile phase, as well as the volume change of a droplet in the emulsion as a function of the initial droplet radius, is presented. The influence of volatile phase solubility, liquid-liquid interfacial tension, and final temperature are explored, accounting for the influence of confinement on the properties of the volatile phase. Beyond this, a means by which the diffusivity of the gas in the continuous liquid phase can be measured is derived.},

abstract = {Centrosomes are highly dynamic, spherical organelles without a membrane. Their physical nature and their assembly are not understood. Using the concept of phase separation, we propose a theoretical description of centrosomes as liquid droplets. In our model, centrosome material occurs in a form soluble in the cytosol and a form that tends to undergo phase separation from the cytosol. We show that an autocatalytic chemical transition between these forms accounts for the temporal evolution observed in experiments. Interestingly, the nucleation of centrosomes can be controlled by an enzymatic activity of the centrioles, which are present at the core of all centrosomes. This nonequilibrium feature also allows for multiple stable centrosomes, a situation that is unstable in equilibrium phase separation. Our theory explains the growth dynamics of centrosomes for all cell sizes down to the eight-cell stage of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, and it also accounts for data acquired in experiments with aberrant numbers of centrosomes and altered cell volumes. Furthermore, the model can describe unequal centrosome sizes observed in cells with perturbed centrioles. We also propose an interpretation of the molecular details of the involved proteins in the case of C. elegans. Our example suggests a general picture of the organization of membraneless organelles.},

abstract = {We explore a generic mechanism whereby a droplet of active matter acquires motility by the spontaneous breakdown of a discrete symmetry. The model we study offers a simple representation of a "cell extract" comprising, e.g., a droplet of actomyosin solution. (Such extracts are used experimentally to model the cytoskeleton). Actomyosin is an active gel whose polarity describes the mean sense of alignment of actin fibres. In the absence of polymerization and depolymerization processes ('treadmilling'), the gel's dynamics arises solely from the contractile motion of myosin motors; this should be unchanged when polarity is inverted. Our results suggest that motility can arise in the absence of treadmilling, by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of polarity inversion symmetry. Adapting our model to wall-bound cells in two dimensions, we find that as wall friction is reduced, treadmilling-induced motility falls but SSB-mediated motility rises. The latter might therefore be crucial in three dimensions where frictional forces are likely to be modest. At a supracellular level, the same generic mechanism can impart motility to aggregates of nonmotile but active bacteria; we show that SSB in this (extensile) case leads generically to rotational as well as translational motion.},

We propose that, in addition to maximizing the expected return, a learner should choose a policy that also maximizes the learner's predictive power. This makes the world both interesting and exploitable. Optimal policies then have the form of Boltzmann-style exploration with a bonus, containing a novel exploration-exploitation trade-off which emerges naturally from the proposed optimization principle. Importantly, this exploration-exploitation trade-off persists in the optimal deterministic policy, i.e., when there is no exploration due to randomness. As a result, exploration is understood as an emerging behavior that optimizes information gain, rather than being modeled as pure randomization of action choices.},

abstract = {We generalize stochastic thermodynamics to include information reservoirs. Such information reservoirs, which can be modeled as a sequence of bits, modify the second law. For example, work extraction from a system in contact with a single heat bath becomes possible if the system also interacts with an information reservoir. We obtain an inequality, and the corresponding fluctuation theorem, generalizing the standard entropy production of stochastic thermodynamics. From this inequality we can derive an information processing entropy production, which gives the second law in the presence of information reservoirs. We also develop a systematic linear response theory for information processing machines. For an uni-cyclic machine powered by an information reservoir, the efficiency at maximum power can deviate from the standard value 1/2. For the case where energy is consumed to erase the tape, the efficiency at maximum erasure is found to be 1/2.},

@article{Foures2013a,
abstract = {Stability theory based on a variational principle and finite-time direct-adjoint optimization commonly relies on the kinetic perturbation energy density E1(t)=(1/V$\Omega$)∫$\Omega$e(x,t)d$\Omega$ (where e(x,t)=|u|2/2) as a measure of disturbance size. This type of optimization typically yields optimal perturbations that are global in the fluid domain $\Omega$ of volume V$\Omega$. This paper explores the use of p-norms in determining optimal perturbations for ‘energy' growth over prescribed time intervals of length T. For p=1 the traditional energy-based stability analysis is recovered, while for large p≫1, localization of the optimal perturbations is observed which identifies confined regions, or ‘hotspots', in the domain where significant energy growth can be expected. In addition, the p-norm optimization yields insight into the role and significance of various regions of the flow regarding the overall energy dynamics. As a canonical example, we choose to solve the ∞-norm optimal perturbation problem for the simple case of two-dimensional channel flow. For such a configuration, several solutions branches emerge, each of them identifying a different energy production zone in the flow: either the centre or the walls of the domain. We study several scenarios (involving centre or wall perturbations) leading to localized energy production for different optimization time intervals. Our investigation reveals that even for this simple two-dimensional channel flow, the mechanism for the production of a highly energetic and localized perturbation is not unique in time. We show that wall perturbations are optimal (with respect to the ∞-norm) for relatively short and long times, while the centre perturbations are preferred for very short and intermediate times. The developed p-norm framework is intended to facilitate worst-case analysis of shear flows and to identify localized regions supporting dominant energy growth.},

@article{Tononi2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consciousness poses two main problems. The first is understanding the conditions that determine to what extent a system has conscious experience. For instance, why is our consciousness generated by certain parts of our brain, such as the thalamocortical system, and not by other parts, such as the cerebellum? And why are we conscious during wakefulness and much less so during dreamless sleep? The second problem is understanding the conditions that determine what kind of consciousness a system has. For example, why do specific parts of the brain contribute specific qualities to our conscious experience, such as vision and audition? PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: This paper presents a theory about what consciousness is and how it can be measured. According to the theory, consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate information. This claim is motivated by two key phenomenological properties of consciousness: differentiation - the availability of a very large number of conscious experiences; and integration - the unity of each such experience. The theory states that the quantity of consciousness available to a system can be measured as the Phi value of a complex of elements. Phi is the amount of causally effective information that can be integrated across the informational weakest link of a subset of elements. A complex is a subset of elements with Phi{\textgreater}0 that is not part of a subset of higher Phi. The theory also claims that the quality of consciousness is determined by the informational relationships among the elements of a complex, which are specified by the values of effective information among them. Finally, each particular conscious experience is specified by the value, at any given time, of the variables mediating informational interactions among the elements of a complex. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The information integration theory accounts, in a principled manner, for several neurobiological observations concerning consciousness. As shown here, these include the association of consciousness with certain neural systems rather than with others; the fact that neural processes underlying consciousness can influence or be influenced by neural processes that remain unconscious; the reduction of consciousness during dreamless sleep and generalized seizures; and the time requirements on neural interactions that support consciousness. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The theory entails that consciousness is a fundamental quantity, that it is graded, that it is present in infants and animals, and that it should be possible to build conscious artifacts.},

Explicit expressions for the stochastic analog of entropy production and related quantities are derived for a dilute solution of Brownian particles in a fluid of light particles. Their statistical properties are analyzed and, in the light of the insights afforded, the thermodynamics of a single Brownian particle is revisited and the status of the second law of thermodynamics is discussed.},

abstract = {A phase shift droplet emulsion is introduced as an aid to unusual ultrasound (US) applications. The transpulmonary droplet emulsion (90{\%} {\textless} 6 $\mu$m diameter) is made by mixing saline, bovine albumin and dodecafluoropentane. It has been observed that an acoustic pressure threshold exists, above which the droplets vaporize into bubbles approximately 25 times the original diameter. For frequencies between 1.5 and 8 MHz, the threshold decreases from 4.5 to 0.75 MPa peak rarefactional pressure. This paper presents preliminary results for droplet preparation and their evaporation as a function of applied acoustic pressure and frequency, as well as simulations of the lifetime of these gas bubbles based on gas diffusion. In vivo experiments were simulated by the evaporation of droplets in blood flowing under attenuating material. We propose that this agent might be useful for tissue occlusion in cancer treatment, as well as for phase aberration corrections in acoustic imaging.

abstract = {Evolutionary game theory is a successful mathematical framework geared towards understanding the selective pressures that affect the evolution of the strategies of agents engaged in interactions with potential conflicts. While a mathematical treatment of the costs and benefits of decisions can predict the optimal strategy in simple settings, more realistic settings such as finite populations, non-vanishing mutations rates, stochastic decisions, communication between agents, and spatial interactions, require agent-based methods where each agent is modeled as an individual, carries its own genes that determine its decisions, and where the evolutionary outcome can only be ascertained by evolving the population of agents forward in time. While highlighting standard mathematical results, we compare those to agent-based methods that can go beyond the limitations of equations and simulate the complexity of heterogeneous populations and an ever-changing set of interactors. We conclude that agent-based methods can predict evolutionary outcomes where purely mathematical treatments cannot tread (for example in the weak selection–strong mutation limit), but that mathematics is crucial to validate the computational simulations.},

The system's state retains information about past environmental fluctuations, and a fraction of this information is predictive of future ones. The remaining nonpredictive information reflects model complexity that does not improve predictive power, and thus represents the ineffectiveness of the model. We expose the fundamental equivalence between this model inefficiency and thermodynamic inefficiency, measured by dissipation. Our results hold arbitrarily far from thermodynamic equilibrium and are applicable to a wide range of systems, including biomolecular machines. They highlight a profound connection between the effective use of information and efficient thermodynamic operation: any system constructed to keep memory about its environment and to operate with maximal energetic efficiency has to be predictive.},

abstract = {We consider the mixing of passive scalars transported in turbulent flow, with a molecular diffusivity that is large compared to the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. This particular case of mixing has not received much attention in experiment or simulation even though the first putative theory, due to Batchelor, Howells {\&} Townsend (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 5, 1959, pp. 134-139), is now more than 50 years old. We study the problem using direct numerical simulation of decaying scalar fields in steadily sustained homogeneous turbulence as the Schmidt number (the ratio of the kinematic viscosity of the fluid to the molecular diffusivity of the scalar) is allowed to vary from 1/8 to 1/2048 for two values of the microscale Reynolds number, R$\lambda$$\backslash$ ≈ 140 and ≈ 240. The simulations show that the passive scalar spectrum assumes a slope of-17/3 in a range of scales, as predicted by the theory, when the Schmidt number is small and the Reynolds number is simultaneously large. The observed agreement between theory and simulation in the prefactor in the spectrum is not perfect. We assess the reasons for this discrepancy by a careful examination of the scalar evolution equation in the light of the assumptions of the theory, and conclude that the finite range of scales resolved in simulations is the main reason. Numerical issues specific to the regime of very low Schmidt numbers are also addressed briefly. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Confined suspensions of active particles show peculiar dynamics characterized by wall accumulation, as well as upstream swimming, centreline depletion and shear trapping when a pressure-driven flow is imposed. We use theory and numerical simulations to investigate the effects of confinement and non-uniform shear on the dynamics of a dilute suspension of Brownian active swimmers by incorporating a detailed treatment of boundary conditions within a simple kinetic model where the configuration of the suspension is described using a conservation equation for the probability distribution function of particle positions and orientations, and where particle–particle and particle–wall hydrodynamic interactions are neglected. Based on this model, we first investigate the effects of confinement in the absence of flow, in which case the dynamics is governed by a swimming P{\'{e}}clet number, or ratio of the persistence length of particle trajectories over the channel width, and a second swimmer-specific parameter whose inverse measures the strength of propulsion. In the limit of weak and strong propulsion, asymptotic expressions for the full distribution function are derived. For finite propulsion, analytical expressions for the concentration and polarization profiles are also obtained using a truncated moment expansion of the distribution function. In agreement with experimental observations, the existence of a concentration/polarization boundary layer in wide channels is reported and characterized, suggesting that wall accumulation in active suspensions is primarily a kinematic effect that does not require hydrodynamic interactions. Next, we show that application of a pressure-driven Poiseuille flow leads to net upstream swimming of the particles relative to the flow, and an analytical expression for the mean upstream velocity is derived in the weak-flow limit. In stronger imposed flows, we also predict the formation of a depletion layer near the channel centreline, due to cross-streamline migration of the swimming particles towards high-shear regions where they become trapped, and an asymptotic analysis in the strong-flow limit is used to obtain a scale for the depletion layer thickness and to rationalize the non-monotonic dependence of the intensity of depletion upon flow rate. Our theoretical predictions are all shown to be in excellent agreement with finite-volume numerical simulations of the kinetic model, and are also supported by recent experiments on bacterial suspensions in microfluidic devices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is a considerable experimental, theoreti-cal, modeling, and computational challenge to capture and represent turbulent mixing which, for high Reynolds number (Re) flows, occurs across a spectrum of scales of considerable span. This consideration alone places high-Re mixing phenomena beyond the reach of direct simulation, especially in high Schmidt number fluids, such as water, in which species diffusion scales are one and a half orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest flow scales. The discussion below attempts to provide an overview of tur-bulent mixing; the attendant experimental, theoretical, and computational challenges; and suggests possible future directions for progress in this important field.},

In particular, we focus on the problem of finding the best-possible driving function lambda(t) that, for a given thermodynamic path, simulation algorithm, and amount of computational effort, minimizes dissipation. From the fluctuation-dissipation theorem it follows that, in the linear-response regime, the dissipation is controlled by the magnitude and characteristic correlation time of the equilibrium fluctuations in the driving force. As a result, the problem of finding the optimal switching scheme involves the solution of a standard problem in variational calculus: the minimization of a functional with respect to the switching function. In practice, the minimization involves solving the associated Euler-Lagrange equation subject to a set of boundary conditions. As a demonstration we apply the approach to the simple, yet illustrative problem of computing the free-energy difference between two classical harmonic oscillators with very different characteristic frequencies.},

Along with finite differences and finite elements, spectral methods are one of the three main technologies for solving partial differential equations on computers. Since spectral methods involve significant linear algebra and graphics they are very suitable for the high level programming of MATLAB. This hands-on introduction is built around forty short and powerful MATLAB programs, which the reader can download from the World Wide Web. This book presents the key ideas along with many figures, examples, and short, elegant MATLAB programs for readers to adapt to their own needs. It covers ODE and PDE boundary value problems, eigenvalues and pseudospectra, linear and nonlinear waves, and numerical quadrature.},

abstract = {A novel EPR stopped-flow accessory is described which allows time-dependent cw-EPR measurements of rate constants of reactions involving paramagnetic species after rapid mixing of two liquid reagents. The EPR stopped-flow design represents a state-of-the-art, computer controlled fluid driving system, a miniresonant EPR structure with an integrated small ball mixer, and a stopping valve. The X-band EPR detection system is an improved version of that reported by Sienkiewicz et al. [Rev. Sci. Instr. 65 (1994) 68], and utilizes a resonator with two stacked ceramic dielectric rings separated by a variable spacer. The resonator with the mode TE(H) 
                        011 is tailored particularly for conditions of fast flowing and rapidly stopped aqueous solutions, and for a high time resolution. The short distance between the ball mixer and the small EPR active volume (1.8 $\mu$l) yields a measured dead time of 330 $\mu$s. A compact assembly of all parts results in minimization of disturbing microphonics. The computer controlled driving system from BioLogic with two independent stepping motors was optimized for EPR stopped-flow with a hard-stop valve. Performance tests on the EPR spectrometer ESP 300E from BRUKER using redox reactions of nitroxide radicals revealed the EPR stopped-flow accessory as an advanced, versatile, and reliable instrument with high reproducibility. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) has been introduced with the potential application of tumor treatment via occlusion and subsequent necrosis. New Zealand White rabbits were anesthetized, and their left kidney was externalized. An imaging array and single-element transducer were positioned in a tank with direct access to the kidney's vasculature and renal artery. Filtered droplet emulsions (diameter {\textless}6 microm) were injected intra-arterially (IA) into the left heart during insonification of the renal artery, and the extent of blood flow reduction by ADV was compared to the untreated right kidney. Flow cytometry (using colored microspheres) of kidney tissue samples and reference blood from the femoral artery allowed the quantitative estimation of regional blood flow. A maximum regional blood flow reduction in the treated region of {\textgreater}90{\%} and an average organ perfusion reduction of {\textgreater}70{\%} was achieved using ADV. After treatment of the left kidney, the control kidney on the contralateral side showed a maximum decrease in regional blood flow of 18{\%} relative to the pre-ADV baseline. Image-based hyper-echogenicity from ADV of IA injections was monitored for approximately 90 minutes, and cortex perfusion was reduced by {\textgreater}60{\%} of its original value for more than 1 hour. This could be enough time for the onset of cell death and possible tumor treatment via ischemic necrosis. Moreover, currently used radiofrequency tissue ablation-based tumor treatment could benefit from ADV due to the decreased heat loss via vascular cooling.},

For this new edition the book has been thoroughly updated throughout. There are new chapters on nonlinear interior methods and derivative-free methods for optimization, both of which are used widely in practice and the focus of much current research. Because of the emphasis on practical methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners in the field. The authors have strived to produce a text that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side.},

We develop a mathematical description of the body dynamics based on a mixed-type boundary integral formulation. We also derive analytic axisymmetric solutions for the case of a single locomoting sphere and ellipsoid based on spherical and ellipsoidal harmonics, and compare our numerical results to these. The hydrodynamic interactions between two spherical and ellipsoidal swimmers in an infinite fluid are then simulated using second-order accurate spatial and temporal discretizations. We find that the near-field interactions result in complex and interesting changes in the locomotors' orientations and trajectories. Stable as well as unstable pairwise swimming motions are observed, similar to the recent findings of Pooley et al. [C.M. Pooley, G.P. Alexander, J.M.

Finally, we describe various application examples (from areas such as continuum mechanics, spacecraft attitude control and quantum spin systems) which show that the differential geometric version of Pontryagin's Principle allows one to obtain solutions for concrete problems not easily found in other ways.

abstract = {A reflection of our ultimate understanding of a complex system is our ability to control its behavior. Typically, control has multiple prerequisites: It requires an accurate map of the network that governs the interactions between the system's components, a quantitative description of the dynamical laws that govern the temporal behavior of each component, and an ability to influence the state and temporal behavior of a selected subset of the components. With deep roots in nonlinear dynamics and control theory, notions of control and controllability have taken a new life recently in the study of complex networks, inspiring several fundamental questions: What are the control principles of complex systems? How do networks organize themselves to balance control with functionality? To address these here we review recent advances on the controllability and the control of complex networks, exploring the intricate interplay between a system's structure, captured by its network topology, and the dynamical laws that govern the interactions between the components. We match the pertinent mathematical results with empirical findings and applications. We show that uncovering the control principles of complex systems can help us explore and ultimately understand the fundamental laws that govern their behavior.},

Stochastic thermodynamics, on the other hand, is a comprehensive theoretical framework for driven systems that allows to define fluctuating work and heat. We apply these definitions to active matter, assuming that dissipation can be modelled by effective non-conservative forces. We show that, through the work, conjugate extensive and intensive observables can be defined even in non-equilibrium steady states lacking a free energy. As an illustration, we derive the expressions for the pressure and interfacial tension of active Brownian particles. The latter becomes negative despite the observed stable phase separation. We discuss this apparent contradiction, highlighting the role of fluctuations, and we offer a tentative explanation.},

In the liquid state, intravascular droplets can extravasate within tumours. Activation is then accomplished by using bursts of ultrasound to vaporize the droplets. We use acoustical and optical techniques to assess the characteristics of vaporized droplets and the resulting microbubbles in vitro, including size, conversion threshold, echogenicity and nonlinearity. Under exposure to single 5-50 cycle bursts of ultrasound at 7.5 MHz and mechanical index {\textless}1.0, droplets with mean diameter of 400 nm convert into microbubbles with mean diameter of 1.4 ??m at 1 ms after vaporization, expanding to 5.6 ??m by 1 s. The growth of microbubbles produced by vaporization causes a characteristic time-dependent increase in linear and nonlinear echogenicity, enabling selective detection with conventional bubble-specific imaging. These results suggest that submicron perfluorocarbon droplets, activated in situ, may be a candidate for an extravascular ultrasound contrast agent. ?? 2011 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine {\&} Biology.},

Combination of the product operator matrix and non-linear Bloch equations is employed to describe effects of chemical shift, translational diffusion, dipolar field, radiation damping, and relaxation in multiple spin systems with both scalar and dipolar couplings. A new simulation algorithm based on this approach is used to simulate NMR signals from dipolar field effects in the presence of scalar couplings. Several typical coupled spin systems with both intra-molecular scalar couplings and inter-molecular dipolar couplings are simulated. Monte Carlo methods are incorporated into simulations as well to analyze diffusion process in these complicated spin systems. The simulated results of diffusion and relaxation parameters and 2D NMR spectra are coincident with the experimental measurements, and agree with theoretical predictions as well. The simulation algorithm presented herein therefore provides a convenient means for designing pulse sequences and quantifying experimental results in complex coupled spin systems. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Numerical simulations were also performed using a boundary element method. P. caudatum was modelled as a rigid spheroid with surface tangential velocity measured by a particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Hydrodynamic interactions observed in the experiment agreed well with the numerical simulations, so we can conclude that the present cell model is appropriate for describing the motion of P. caudatum.},

Its properties can be linked to general localization effects such as the presence of negative differential conductivity, of jamming or glassy behavior or of the slowing down of thermalization.

abstract = {Force generation in several types of cell motility is driven by rapidly elongating cytoskeletal filaments that are persistently tethered at their polymerizing ends to propelled objects. These properties are not easily explained by force-generation models that require free (i.e., untethered) filament ends to fluctuate away from the surface for addition of new monomers. In contrast, filament end-tracking proteins that processively advance on filament ends can facilitate rapid elongation and substantial force generation by persistently tethered filaments. Such processive end-tracking proteins, termed here filament end-tracking motors, maintain possession of filament ends and, like other biomolecular motors, advance by means of 5'-nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis-driven affinity-modulated interactions. On-filament NTP hydrolysis/phosphate release yields substantially more energy than that required for driving steady-state assembly/disassembly of free filament ends (i.e., filament treadmilling), as revealed by an energy inventory on the treadmilling cycle. The kinetic and thermodynamic properties of two simple end-tracking mechanisms (an end-tracking stepping motor and a direct-transfer end-tracking motor) are analyzed to illustrate the advantages of an end-tracking motor over free filament-end elongation, and over passive end-trackers that operate without the benefit of NTP hydrolysis, in terms of generating force, facilitating rapid monomer addition, and maintaining tight possession of the filament ends. We describe an additional cofactor-assisted end-tracking motor to account for suggested roles of cofactors in the affinity-modulated interactions, such as profilin in actin-filament end-tracking motors and EB1 in microtubule end-tracking motors.},

abstract = {Optimal control theory is a mature mathematical discipline with numerous applications in both science and engineering. It is emerging as the computational framework of choice for studying the neural control of movement, in much the same way that probabilistic inference is emerging as the computational framework of choice for studying sensory information processing. Despite the growing popularity of optimal control models, however, the elaborate mathematical machinery behind them is rarely exposed and the big picture is hard to grasp without reading a few technical books on the subject. While this chapter cannot replace such books, it aims to provide a self-contained mathematical introduction to optimal control theory that is sufficiently broad and yet succiently detailed when it comes to key concepts. The text is not tailored to the field of motor control (apart from the last section, and the overall emphasis on systems with continuous state) so it will hopefully be of interest to a wider audience. Of special interest in the context of this book is the material on the duality of optimal control and probabilistic inference; such duality suggests that neural information processing in sensory and motor areas may be more similar than currently thought.},

abstract = {Swimming microorganisms such as bacteria or spermatozoa are typically found in dense suspensions, and exhibit collective modes of locomotion qualitatively different from that displayed by isolated cells. In the dilute limit where fluid-mediated interactions can be treated rigorously, the long-time hydrodynamics of a collection of cells result from interactions with many other cells, and as such typically eludes an analytical approach. Here, we consider the only case where such problem can be treated rigorously analytically, namely when the cells have spatially confined trajectories, such as the spermatozoa of some marine invertebrates. We consider two spherical cells swimming, when isolated, with arbitrary circular trajectories, and derive the long-time kinematics of their relative locomotion. We show that in the dilute limit where the cells are much further away than their size, and the size of their circular motion, a separation of time scale occurs between a fast (intrinsic) swimming time, and a slow time where hydrodynamic interactions lead to change in the relative position and orientation of the swimmers. We perform a multiple-scale analysis and derive the effective dynamical system--of dimension two--describing the long-time behavior of the pair of cells. We show that the system displays one type of equilibrium, and two types of rotational equilibrium, all of which are found to be unstable. A detailed mathematical analysis of the dynamical systems further allows us to show that only two cell-cell behaviors are possible in the limit of t--{\textgreater}infinity, either the cells are attracted to each other (possibly monotonically), or they are repelled (possibly monotonically as well), which we confirm with numerical computations. Our analysis shows therefore that, even in the dilute limit, hydrodynamic interactions lead to new modes of cell-cell locomotion.},

abstract = {A deeper understanding of nonequilibrium phenomena is needed to reveal the principles governing natural and synthetic molecular machines. Recent work has shown that when a thermodynamic system is driven from equilibrium then, in the linear response regime, the space of controllable parameters has a Riemannian geometry induced by a generalized friction tensor. We exploit this geometric insight to construct closed-form expressions for minimal-dissipation protocols for a particle diffusing in a one-dimensional harmonic potential, where the spring constant, inverse temperature, and trap location are adjusted simultaneously. These optimal protocols are geodesics on the Riemannian manifold and reveal that this simple model has a surprisingly rich geometry. We test these optimal protocols via a numerical implementation of the Fokker-Planck equation and demonstrate that the friction tensor arises naturally from a first-order expansion in temporal derivatives of the control parameters, without appealing directly to linear response theory.},

Here, we use enhanced sampling computational methods and analytic theory to examine the kinetics of formation of the dense phase. Despite the intrinsically nonequilibrium nature of the phase transition, we show that the kinetics can be described using a framework analogous to equilibrium classical nucleation theory, governed by an effective free energy of cluster formation, with identifiable bulk and surface terms. The theory captures the location of the binodal, nucleation rates as a function of supersaturation, and the cluster size distributions below the binodal, while discrepancies in the metastable region reveal additional physics about the early stages of active crystal formation. The success of the theory shows that tools from equilibrium statistical mechanics can provide insights into the kinetics of evolution toward nonequilibrium steady-states in active matter systems.},

Here we use the digital evolution system Avida to study the origin of self-replicating computer programs. By using a computational system, we avoid many of the uncertainties inherent in any biochemical system of self-replicators (while running the risk of ignoring a fundamental aspect of biochemistry). We generated the exhaustive set of minimal-genome self-replicators and analyzed the network structure of this fitness landscape. We further examined the evolvability of these self-replicators and found that the evolvability of a self-replicator is dependent on its genomic architecture. We studied the differential ability of replicators to take over the population when competed against each other (akin to a primordial-soup model of biogenesis) and found that the probability of a self-replicator out-competing the others is not uniform. Instead, progenitor (most-recent common ancestor) genotypes are clustered in a small region of the replicator space. Our results demonstrate how computational systems can be used as test systems for hypotheses concerning the origin of life.},

abstract = {Since about a decade various fluctuation relations for the entropy production have been derived and analyzed. These relations deal with symmetries of the entropy production under time-reversal and have been proposed as a non-perturbative generalization of fluctuation—dissipation relations. I describe a unifying framework for understanding these relations and I present an algorithm to derive them. The fluctuation relations all follow from the main observation that in great generality the path-dependent entropy production is the source-term of time-reversal breaking in the Lagrangian over space-time histories. That is illustrated via a number of examples as well as via a general theoretical argument. I move these relations away from the strict dynamical background in which they originated and take them back to the context of statistical mechanics where entropy is understood in the sense of Boltzmann, as measuring the typicality of a manifest condition. I discuss how a relation between work and free energy is naturally put in that framework and how the transient and steady state fluctuation theorems are simple consequences. The fact that fluctuation symmetries for the entropy production are in general only valid asymptotically for large times, makes them mostly inaccessible for experimental verification, in contrast with a recent claim that they would usefully quantify second law violations. Part of the interest in the resulting fluctuation symmetries is that they are so universally valid, a rare occasion in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. However they do not provide a systematic perturbation expansion for response functions. For that one needs to go back to the full Lagrangian and also consider the nonequilibrium modifications to its time-symmetric part.},

This is supplemented by the description of typical mixing element designs, methods for mixing characterisation, and application fields. The mixing principles applied can be divided in two classes relying either on the pumping energy or provision of other external energy to achieve mixing, termed passive and active mixing, respectively. As far as passive mixing is concerned, devices and techniques such as Y- and T-type flow-, multi-laminating-, split-and-recombine-, chaotic-, jet colliding-, recirculation flow-mixers and others are discussed. Active mixing can be accomplished by time-pulsing flow owing to a periodical change of pumping energy or electrical fields, acoustic fluid shaking, ultrasound, electrowetting-based droplet shaking, microstirrers, and others. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Free-energy differences computed from fast-switching simulations or measurements according to the Jarzynski equation are independent of the particular protocol specifying how the control parameter is changed in time. In contrast, the average work carried out on the system as well the accuracy of the resulting free energy strongly depend on the protocol. Recently, Schmiedl and Seifert [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 108301 (2007)] found that protocols that minimize the average work for a given duration of the switching process have discrete steps at the beginning and the end. Here we determine numerically the protocols that minimize the statistical error in the free energy estimate and find that such minimum error protocols have similar discrete jumps. Our analysis shows that the reduction in computational effort achieved by the use of steplike protocols can be considerable. Such large savings of computing time, however, typically occur for parameter ranges in which an application of the Jarzynski equation is impractical due to large statistical errors arising from the exponential work average.},

These groups are matrix subgroups of the general linear group that are defined by a quadratic matrix identity. Their corresponding Lie algebras include several classical semisimple matrix Lie algebras. The approach is to start with an optimal control problem on these groups that generates geodesics for a left-invariant metric. Earlier work by Bloch, Crouch, Marsden, and Ratiu defines the symmetric representation of the rigid body equations, which is obtained by solving the same optimal control problem in the particular case of the Lie group SO ( n ). This paper generalizes this symmetric representation to a wider class of matrix groups satisfying a certain quadratic matrix identity. We consider the relationship between this symmetric representation of the generalized rigid body equations and the generalized rigid body equations themselves. A discretization of this symmetric representation is constructed making use of the symmetry, which in turn give rise to numerical algorithms to integrate the generalized rigid body equations for the given class of matrix Lie groups.},

abstract = {We study advection-diffusion of a passive scalar, T, by an incompressible fluid in a closed vessel bounded by walls impermeable to the fluid. Variations in T are produced by prescribing a steady non-uniform distribution of T at the boundary. Because there is no flow through the walls, molecular diffusion, kappa, is essential in 'lifting' T off the boundary and into the interior where the velocity field acts to intensify delT. We prove that as kappa --{\textgreater} 0 (with the fluid velocity fixed) this diffusive lifting is a feeble source of scalar variance. Consequently the scalar dissipation rate chi - the volume integral of kappa$\backslash$delT$\backslash$(2) - vanishes in the limit kappa --{\textgreater} 0. Thus, in this particular closed-flow configuration, it is not possible to maintain a constant supply of scalar variance as K --{\textgreater} 0 and the fundamental premise of scaling theories for passive scalar cascades is violated.We also obtain a weaker bound on X when the transported field is a dynamically active scalar, such as temperature. This bound applies to the Rayleigh-Benard configuration in which T = +/-1 on two parallel plates at z = +/-h/2. In this case we show that chi less than or equal to 3.252 x (kappaepsilon/vh(2))(1/3) where v is the viscosity and E is the mechanical energy dissipation per unit mass. Thus, provided that epsilon and nu/kappa are non-zero in the limit kappa --{\textgreater} 0. chi might remain non-zero.},

abstract = {Although it has been notoriously difficult to pin down precisely what it is that makes life so distinctive and remarkable, there is general agreement that its informational aspect is one key property, perhaps the key property. The unique informational narrative of living systems suggests that life may be characterized by context-dependent causal influences, and in particular, that top-down (or downward) causation -- where higher-levels influence and constrain the dynamics of lower-levels in organizational hierarchies -- may be a major contributor to the hierarchal structure of living systems. Here we propose that the origin of life may correspond to a physical transition associated with a shift in causal structure, where information gains direct, and context-dependent causal efficacy over the matter it is instantiated in. Such a transition may be akin to more traditional physical transitions (e.g. thermodynamic phase transitions), with the crucial distinction that determining which phase (non-life or life) a given system is in requires dynamical information and therefore can only be inferred by identifying causal architecture. We discuss some potential novel research directions based on this hypothesis, including potential measures of such a transition that may be amenable to laboratory study, and how the proposed mechanism corresponds to the onset of the unique mode of (algorithmic) information processing characteristic of living systems.},

abstract = {There have been several highway traffic models proposed based on cellular automata. The simplest one is elementary cellular automaton rule 184. We extend this model to city traffic with cellular automata coupled at intersections using only rules 184, 252, and 136. The simplicity of the model offers a clear understanding of the main properties of city traffic and its phase transitions. We use the proposed model to compare two methods for coordinating traffic lights: a green-wave method that tries to optimize phases according to expected flows and a self-organizing method that adapts to the current traffic conditions. The self-organizing method delivers considerable improvements over the green-wave method. For low densities, the self-organizing method promotes the formation and coordination of platoons that flow freely in four directions, i.e. with a maximum velocity and no stops. For medium densities, the method allows a constant usage of the intersections, exploiting their maximum flux capacity. For high densities, the method prevents gridlocks and promotes the formation and coordination of "free-spaces" that flow in the opposite direction of traffic.},

abstract = {AbstractLearning, defined as a change in behaviour evoked by experience, has hitherto been investigated almost exclusively in multicellular neural organisms. Evidence for learning in non-neural multicellular organisms is scant, and only a few unequivocal reports of learning have been described in single-celled organisms. Here we demonstrate habituation, an unmistakable form of learning, in the non-neural organism Physarum polycephalum. In our experiment, using chemotaxis as the behavioural output and quinine or caffeine as the stimulus, we showed that P. polycephalum learnt to ignore quinine or caffeine when the stimuli were repeated, but responded again when the stimulus was withheld for a certain time. Our results meet the principle criteria that have been used to demonstrate habituation: responsiveness decline and spontaneous recovery. To distinguish habituation from sensory adaptation or motor fatigue, we also show stimulus specificity. Our results point to the diversity of organisms lacking neurons, which likely display a hitherto unrecognized capacity for learning, and suggest that slime moulds may be an ideal model system in which to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying learning processes. Besides, documenting learning in non-neural organisms such as slime moulds is centrally important to a comprehensive, phylogenetic understanding of when and where in the tree of life the earliest manifestations of learning evolved.},

@article{Seifert2012a,
abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

abstract = {The tendency of the entropy to a maximum as an isolated system is relaxed to the equilibrium (the second law of thermodynamics) has been known since the mid-19th century. However, independent theoretical and applied studies, which suggested the maximization of the entropy production during nonequilibrium processes (the so-called maximum entropy production principle, MEPP), appeared in the 20th century. Publications on this topic were fragmented and different research teams, which were concerned with this principle, were unaware of studies performed by other scientists. As a result, the recognition and the use of MEPP by a wider circle of researchers were considerably delayed. The objectives of the present review consist in summation and analysis of studies dealing with MEPP. The first part of the review is concerned with the thermodynamic and statistical basis of the principle (including the relationship of MEPP with the second law of thermodynamics and Prigogine's principle). Various existing applications of the principle to analysis of nonequilibrium systems will be discussed in the second part. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lan2004,
abstract = {The question of controllability is investigated for a quantum control system in which the Hamiltonian operator components carry explicit time dependence which is not under the control of an external agent. We consider the general situation in which the state moves in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, a drift term is present, and the operators driving the state evolution may be unbounded. However, considerations are restricted by the assumption that there exists an analytic domain, dense in the state space, on which solutions of the controlled Schrodinger equation may be expressed globally in exponential form. The issue of controllability then naturally focuses on the ability to steer the quantum state on a finite-dimensional submanifold of the unit sphere in Hilbert space -- and thus on analytic controllability. A relatively straightforward strategy allows the extension of Lie-algebraic conditions for strong analytic controllability derived earlier for the simpler, time-independent system in which the drift Hamiltonian and the interaction Hamiltonia have no intrinsic time dependence. Enlarging the state space by one dimension corresponding to the time variable, we construct an augmented control system that can be treated as time-independent. Methods developed by Kunita can then be implemented to establish controllability conditions for the one-dimension-reduced system defined by the original time-dependent Schrodinger control problem. The applicability of the resulting theorem is illustrated with selected examples.},

abstract = {Experiments in coherent spectroscopy correspond to control of quantum mechanical ensembles guiding them from initial to final target states. The control inputs (pulse sequences) that accomplish these transformations should be designed to minimize the effects of relaxation and to optimize the sensitivity of the experiments. For example in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a question of fundamental importance is what is the maximum efficiency of coherence or polarization transfer between two spins in the presence of relaxation. Furthermore, what is the optimal pulse sequence which achieves this efficiency? In this paper, we give analytical answers to the above questions. Unexpected gains in sensitivity are reported for one of the most commonly used experimental building blocks in NMR spectroscopy. Surprisingly, in the case when longitudinal relaxation is small, the relaxation optimized pulse elements (ROPE) that transfer maximum polarization between coupled spins are longer than conventional sequences. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Research on eukaryotic cytokinesis using advantageous model systems is rapidly advancing our understanding of most aspects of the process. Cytokinesis is very complicated with more than 100 proteins participating. Both fungi and animal cells use proteins to mark the cleavage site for the assembly of a contractile ring of actin filaments and myosin-II. Formins nucleate and elongate the actin filaments and myosin-II helps to organize the filaments into a contractile ring. Much is still to be learned about the organization of the contractile ring and the mechanisms that disassemble the ring as it constricts. Although fungi and animals share many proteins that contribute to cytokinesis, the extent to which they share mechanisms for the location, assembly, constriction, and disassembly of their contractile rings is still in question. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy, coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray system (ESEM-EDX) were used for the determination of the morphological, chemical and mineralogical characteristics of the potsherds. The preliminary results indicated a rather local provenance of the analyzed ancient pottery samples and a finer texture and thus better ceramic manufacture as getting to hellenistic era. The use of a silicious or calcerous raw material is probably related to the specific utilization of each ceramic vessel in ancient times. The presence of gehlenite or pyroxene minerals in the ceramic matrix indicated higher firing temperatures, while lower temperatures were deduced when finding phylosilicate minerals. The preliminary results of this study do not necessarily imply that all the pottery of this area, belonging to the same chronological type, have similar physicochemical characteristics. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It is shown that a simpler solution is to record a tilted projection of the three-dimensional spectrum, derived by Fourier transformation of the time-domain signal acquired while the two evolution parameters are varied simultaneously at the appropriate rates. By avoiding the need to record the full three-dimensional spectrum, this saves an order of magnitude in measurement time. The tilt technique is illustrated by reference to degenerate responses in the TOCSY and NOESY spectra of a small protein, agitoxin, where the 1H and 15N frequencies are incremented in tandem. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Suspensions of activeparticles, such as motile microorganisms and artificial microswimmers, are known to undergo atransition to complex large-scale dynamics at high enough concentrations. While a number ofmodels have demonstratedthat hydrodynamicinteractions can in some cases explain these dynamics, collective motion in experiments is typicallyobserved at such high volume fractions that steric interactions between nearby swimmers aresignificant and cannot be neglected. This raises the question of the respective roles of steric vshydrodynamic interactions inthese dense systems, which we address in this paper using a continuum theory and numerical simulations. Themodel we propose is based onour previous kinetic theoryfor dilute suspensions, inwhich a conservation equation for the distribution function of particle configurations is coupled to theStokes equations for thefluid motion [D. Saintillan and M. J. Shelley,“Instabilities, pattern formation, and mixing in active suspensions,” Phys.Fluids20, 123304 (2008)]. At high volume fractions,steric interactions are captured by extending classic models for concentrated suspensions of rodlike polymers, in which contacts between nearbyparticles cause them to align locally. In the absence of hydrodynamic interactions, this local alignment results in a transitionfrom an isotropic base state to a nematic base state when volume fraction is increased. Using alinear stability analysis, we first investigate the hydrodynamic stability of both states. Our analysis shows thatsuspensions of pushers, orrear-actuated swimmers, typically become unstable in the isotropic state before the transitionoccurs; suspensions ofpullers, or head-actuated swimmers, can also become unstable, though the emergence of unsteady flows in this case occurs at ahigher concentration, above the nematic transition. These results are also confirmed using fullynonlinear numerical simulations in a periodic cubic domain, where pusher and puller suspensions are indeed both found toexhibit instabilities atsufficiently high volume fractions; these instabilities lead to unsteady chaotic states characterized by large-scalecorrelated motions and strong density fluctuations. While the dynamics in suspensions of pushers are similar to thosepreviously reported in the dilute regime, the instability of pullers is novel and typically characterized by slowerdynamics and weaker hydrodynamic velocities and active input power than in pusher suspensions at the same volumefraction.},

abstract = {This report provides a topical review of transport in geophysical scale fluids. Rather than presenting an extensive synopsis of the literature, we attempt to connect some recent developments with an incisive 1948 paper by Eckart [1] in which three phases in the evolution of a tracer in turbulent flows were outlined and discussed. The interest here is on the intermediate or stirring phase, which is dominated by the fluid deformation rate. We relate Eckart's concept of stirring with recent efforts to identify ephemeral spatio-temporal channels that provide a template for transport in geophysical fluid flows. Heretofore such studies have been restricted to a few selected surfaces in the ocean or atmosphere. An application to a large ocean eddy in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates the methodology and shows that the eddy exchanges mass with its environment through material channels identified in the Lagrangian frame by finite-time dynamical systems techniques. We extend previous studies by determining the vertical extent of these transport pathways. The key finding is that the time-dependent geometric structures, which lead to formation of these pathways, retain their coherence well into the water column. Finally, we comment on the significance of these findings on parameterizations of transport processes in predictive models and on the life cycle of ocean mesoscale eddies. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this review, the history of PCCAs, physical mechanisms involved, and proposed applications are discussed with a summary of studies demonstrated in vivo.

These two systems demonstrate spontaneous symmetry breaking and steady state dynamics resembling cell motility and division and show complex feedback mechanisms with minimal degrees of freedom.

abstract = {Drops of active liquid crystal have recently shown the ability to self-propel, which was associated with topological defects in the orientation of active filaments [Sanchez et al., Nature 491, 431 (2013)]. Here, we study the onset and different aspects of motility of a three-dimensional drop of active fluid on a planar surface. We analyze theoretically how motility is affected by orientation profiles with defects of various types and locations, by the shape of the drop, and by surface friction at the substrate. In the scope of a thin drop approximation, we derive exact expressions for the flow in the drop that is generated by a given orientation profile. The flow has a natural decomposition into terms that depend entirely on the geometrical properties of the orientation profile, i.e., its bend and splay, and a term coupling the orientation to the shape of the drop. We find that asymmetric splay or bend generates a directed bulk flow and enables the drop to move, with maximal speeds achieved when the splay or bend is induced by a topological defect in the interior of the drop. In motile drops the direction and speed of self-propulsion is controlled by friction at the substrate.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that during the early steps in the origin of life, small droplets could have formed via the segregation of molecules from complex mixtures by phase separation. These droplets could have provided chemical reaction centers. However, whether these droplets could divide and propagate is unclear. Here we examine the behavior of droplets in systems that are maintained away from thermodynamic equilibrium by an external supply of energy. In these systems, droplets grow by the addition of droplet material generated by chemical reactions. Surprisingly, we find that chemically driven droplet growth can lead to shape instabilities that trigger the division of droplets into two smaller daughters. Therefore, chemically active droplets can exhibit cycles of growth and division that resemble the proliferation of living cells. Dividing active droplets could serve as a model for prebiotic protocells, where chemical reactions in the droplet play the role of a prebiotic metabolism.},

We show, in particular, that minimizing expected heat released or work done during a non-equilibrium transition in finite time is solved by Burgers equation of Cosmology and mass transport by the Burgers velocity field.

abstract = {Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives when interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning. Their discussion ranges from the history of the field's intellectual foundations to the most recent developments and applications. The only necessary mathematical background is familiarity with elementary concepts of probability. The book is divided into three parts. Part I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. Part II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning. Part III presents a unified view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks, eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case studies and consider the future of reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {PREFACE Teaching stochastic processes to students whose primary interests are in applications has long been a problem. On one hand, the subject can quickly become highly technical and if mathematical concerns are allowed to dominate there may be no time available for exploring the many interesting areas of applications. On the other hand, the treatment of stochastic calculus in a cavalier fashion leaves the student with a feeling of great uncertainty when it comes to exploring new material. Moreover, the problem has become more acute as the power of the differential equation point of view has become more widely appreciated. In these notes, an attempt is made to resolve this dilemma with the needs of those interested in building models and designing algorithms for estimation and control in mind. The approach is to start with Poisson counters and to identify the Wiener process with a certain limiting form. We do not attempt to define the Wiener process per se. Instead, everything is done in terms of limits of jump processes. The Poisson counter and differential equations whose right-hand sides include the differential of Poisson counters are developed first. This leads to the construction of a sample path representations of a continuous time jump process using Poisson counters. This point of view leads to an efficient problem solving technique and permits a unified treatment of time varying and nonlinear problems. More importantly, it provides sound intuition for stochastic differential equations and their uses without allowing the technicalities to dominate. In treating estimation theory, the conditional density equa-tion is given a central role. In addition to the standard additive white noise observation models, a number of other models are developed as well. For example, the wide spread interest in problems arising in speech recognition and computer vision has influenced the choice of topics in several places.},

abstract = {Actin filaments and myosin II are evolutionarily conserved force-generating components of the contractile ring during cytokinesis. Here we show that in budding yeast, actin filament depolymerization plays a major role in actomyosin ring constriction. Cofilin mutation or chemically stabilizing actin filaments attenuate actomyosin ring constriction. Deletion of myosin II motor domain or the myosin regulatory light chain reduced the contraction rate and also the rate of actin depolymerization in the ring. We constructed a quantitative microscopic model of actomyosin ring constriction via filament sliding driven by both actin depolymerization and myosin II motor activity. Model simulations based on experimental measurements support the notion that actin depolymerization is the predominant mechanism for ring constriction. The model predicts invariability of total contraction time regardless of the initial ring size, as originally reported for C. elegans embryonic cells. This prediction was validated in yeast cells of different sizes due to different ploidies.},

If artificial chemistries can deal with such systems in beneficial ways, they may facilitate activities in the new area of biomolecular engineering. In order to explore such possibilities, we illustrate four models of biochemical pathways described in our artificial chemistry based on string pattern matching and recombination. The modeled pathways are the replication of DNA, transcription from DNA to mRNA, translation from mRNA to protein, and the oxidation of fatty acids. The descriptions show that the present approach has good modularity and scalability that will be useful for modeling a huge network of pathways. Moreover, we give a procedure to perform reasoning in the artificial chemistry, which checks whether a specified collection of molecules can be generated in a given model, and we demonstrate that it works on a model that describes a natural biochemical pathway.},

abstract = {Open-ended evolution (OEE) is relevant to a variety of biological, artificial and technological systems, but has been challenging to reproduce in silico. Most theoretical efforts focus on key aspects of open-ended evolution as it appears in biology. We recast the problem as a more general one in dynamical systems theory, providing simple criteria for open-ended evolution based on two hallmark features: unbounded evolution and innovation. We define unbounded evolution as patterns that are non-repeating within the expected Poincare recurrence time of an equivalent isolated system, and innovation as trajectories not observed in isolated systems. As a case study, we implement novel variants of cellular automata (CA) in which the update rules are allowed to vary with time in three alternative ways. Each is capable of generating conditions for open-ended evolution, but vary in their ability to do so. We find that state-dependent dynamics, widely regarded as a hallmark of life, statistically out-performs other candidate mechanisms, and is the only mechanism to produce open-ended evolution in a scalable manner, essential to the notion of ongoing evolution. This analysis suggests a new framework for unifying mechanisms for generating OEE with features distinctive to life and its artifacts, with broad applicability to biological and artificial systems.},

abstract = {This thesis introduces a Markov chain approach that allows a rigorous analysis of a class of agent-based models (ABMs). It provides a general framework of aggregation in agent-based and related computational models by making use of Markov chain aggregation and lumpability theory in order to link between the micro and the macro level of observation. The starting point is a microscopic Markov chain description of the dynamical process in complete correspondence with the dynamical behavior of the agent model, which is obtained by considering the set of all possible agent configurations as the state space of a huge Markov chain. This is referred to as micro chain, and an explicit formal representation including microscopic transition rates can be derived for a class of models by using the random mapping representation of a Markov process. The explicit micro formulation enables the application of the theory of Markov chain aggregation -- namely, lumpability -- in order to reduce the state space of the micro chain and relate microscopic descriptions to a macroscopic formulation of interest. Well-known conditions for lumpability make it possible to establish the cases where the macro model is still Markov, and in this case we obtain a complete picture of the dynamics including the transient stage, the most interesting phase in applications. For such a purpose a crucial role is played by the type of probability distribution used to implement the stochastic part of the model which defines the updating rule and governs the dynamics. Namely, if we decide to remain at a Markovian level, then the partition, or equivalently, the collective variables used to build the macro model must be compatible with the symmetries of the probability distribution $\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$omega{\}}. This underlines the theoretical importance of homogeneous or complete mixing in the analysis of {\{}$\backslash$guillemotright{\}}voter-like{\{}$\backslash$guillemotleft{\}} models at use in population genetics, evolutionary game theory and social dynamics. On the other hand, if a favored level of observation is not compatible with the symmetries in $\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$omega{\}}, a certain amount of memory is introduced by the transition from the micro level to such a macro description, and this is the fingerprint of emergence in ABMs. The resulting divergence from Markovianity can be quantified using information-theoretic measures and the thesis presents a scenario in which these measures can be explicitly computed. Two simple models are used to illustrate these theoretical ideas: the voter model (VM) and an extension of it called contrarian voter model (CVM). Using these examples, the thesis shows that Markov chain theory allows for a rather precise understanding of the model dynamics in case of {\{}$\backslash$guillemotright{\}}simple{\{}$\backslash$guillemotleft{\}} population structures where a tractable macro chain can be derived. Constraining the system by interaction networks with a strong local structure leads to the emergence of meta-stable states in the transient of the model. Constraints on the interaction behavior such as bounded confidence or assortative mating lead to the emergence of new absorbing states in the associated macro chain and are related to stable patterns of polarization (stable co-existence of different opinions or species). Constraints and heterogeneities in the microscopic system and complex social interactions are the basic characteristics of ABMs, and the Markov chain approach to link the micro chain to a macro level description (and likewise the failure of a Markovian link) highlights the crucial role played by those ingredients in the generation of complex macroscopic outcomes.},

We then discuss generic features of the dynamics of single active colloids in bulk and in confinement, as well as in the presence of gravity, field gradients, and fluid flow. In the third part, we review the emergent collective behavior of active colloidal suspensions focussing on their structural and dynamic properties. After summarizing experimental observations, we give an overview on the progress in modeling collectively moving active colloids. While active Brownian particles are heavily used to study collective dynamics on large scales, more advanced methods are necessary to explore the importance of hydrodynamic and phoretic particle interactions. Finally, the relevant physical approaches to quantify the emergent collective behavior are presented.},

The method was discovered in 1988, further developed in the first half of the 1990's and reached full maturity in the last decade. The original LBM was extended in many ways, in the direction of multiphase flows, thermal flows, suspension flows, and to include turbulence, chemical reactions and solute transport. The basic theory of LBM for single-phase flow is well established, although even today research papers are being published that address subtle issues in the theory. Moreover, understanding of the embedding of the LBM in the broader context of the continuous Boltzmann equation, the macroscopic Navier Stokes equations, and microscopic theories is by now well understood. In this document the Lattice Boltzmann Method will first be introduced, followed by a theoretical demonstration that the model indeed mimics incompressible hydrodynamics. Next, the embedding of the method in both microscopic – and macroscopic theories will be clarified.},

Our model is also applied to calculate the swim pressure in the system, which approaches the previously proposed ideal-gas behaviour in wide channels but is found to decrease in narrow channels as a result of confinement. Monte Carlo simulations are also performed for validation and show excellent quantitative agreement with our theoretical predictions.},

First we consider a droplet with a concentration of active contractile matter adsorbed to its boundary. We analytically predict activity driven instabilities in the concentration profile, and then simulate the system to find the steady states. Secondly, we consider a droplet of active polar fluid of constant concentration. In this system we predict, motion and deformation of the droplets in certain activity ranges due to instabilities in the polarisation field. Both these systems show generic routes to motility and deformation in active fluid droplet systems which resemble dynamics of the cell cytoskeleton in animal cells.},

We focus on alignment dynamics of a coplanar pair of elongated swimmers, which propel themselves either by "pushing" or "pulling" both in three- and quasi-two-dimensional geometries of space. We derive asymptotic expressions for the dynamics of the pair, which complemented by numerical experiments, indicate that the tendency of bacteria to swim in or swim off depends strongly on the position of the propulsion force. In particular, we observe that positioning of the effective propulsion force inside the dumbbell results in qualitative agreement with the dynamics observed in experiments, such as mutual alignment of converging bacteria.},

In thermal equilibrium, the pressure depends only on bulk properties (density, temperature, etc.) through an equation of state. Here we show that in active systems containing self-propelled particles, the pressure instead can depend on the precise interactions between the system's contents and its confining walls. Generic active fluids therefore have no equation of state. We show how one is recovered in certain limiting cases, which include "active Brownian spheres", a much-studied simplified model of self-propelled particles. Even in these cases, the mechanical pressure can exhibit anomalous properties that defy the familiar thermodynamic description of passive fluid materials.},

We discuss various other aspects of the Euler equations from a pedagogical point of view. We show that the Hamiltonian in the maximum principle is given by the pairing of the Eulerian impulse density with the velocity. We provide a comparative discussion of the flow equations in their Eulerian and Lagrangian form and describe how these forms occur naturally in the context of optimal control. We demonstrate that the extremal equations corresponding to the optimal control problem for the flow have a natural canonical symplectic structure.},

abstract = {Conducting large-scale solid-state NMR simulations requires fast computer software potentially in combination with efficient computational resources to complete within a reasonable time frame. Such simulations may involve large spin systems, multiple-parameter fitting of experimental spectra, or multiple-pulse experiment design using parameter scan, non-linear optimization, or optimal control procedures. To efficiently accommodate such simulations, we here present an improved version of the widely distributed open-source SIMPSON NMR simulation software package adapted to contemporary high performance hardware setups. The software is optimized for fast performance on standard stand-alone computers, multi-core processors, and large clusters of identical nodes. We describe the novel features for fast computation including internal matrix manipulations, propagator setups and acquisition strategies. For efficient calculation of powder averages, we implemented interpolation method of Alderman, Solum, and Grant, as well as recently introduced fast Wigner transform interpolation technique. The potential of the optimal control toolbox is greatly enhanced by higher precision gradients in combination with the efficient optimization algorithm known as limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno. In addition, advanced parallelization can be used in all types of calculations, providing significant time reductions. SIMPSON is thus reflecting current knowledge in the field of numerical simulations of solid-state NMR experiments. The efficiency and novel features are demonstrated on the representative simulations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Natural ventilation of buildings is the flow generated by temperature differences and by the wind. The governing feature of this flow is the exchange between an interior space and the external ambient. Although the wind may often appear to be the dominant driving mechanism, in many circumstances temperature variations play a controlling feature on the ventilation since the directional buoyancy force has a large influence on the flow patterns within the space and on the nature of the exchange with the outside. Two forms of ventilation are discussed: mixing ventilation, in which the interior is at an approximately uniform temperature, and displacement ventilation, where there is strong internal stratification. The dynamics of these buoyancy-driven flows are considered, and the effects of wind on them are examined. The aim behind this work is to give designers rules and intuition on how air moves within a building; the research reveals a fascinating branch of fluid mechanics.},

abstract = {Common algorithms for computationally simulating Langevin dynamics must discretize the stochastic differential equations of motion. These resulting finite-time-step integrators necessarily have several practical issues in common: Microscopic reversibility is violated, the sampled stationary distribution differs from the desired equilibrium distribution, and the work accumulated in nonequilibrium simulations is not directly usable in estimators based on nonequilibrium work theorems. Here, we show that, even with a time-independent Hamiltonian, finite-time-step Langevin integrators can be thought of as a driven, nonequilibrium physical process. Once an appropriate worklike quantity is defined—here called the shadow work—recently developed nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems can be used to measure or correct for the errors introduced by the use of finite time steps. In particular, we demonstrate that amending estimators based on nonequilibrium work theorems to include this shadow work removes the time-step- dependent error from estimates of free energies. We also quantify, for the first time, the magnitude of deviations between the sampled stationary distribution and the desired equilibrium distribution for equilibrium Langevin simulations of solvated systems of varying sizes. While these deviations can be large, they can be eliminated altogether by Metropolization or greatly diminished by small reductions in the time step. Through this connection with driven processes, further developments in nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems can provide additional analytical tools for dealing with errors in finite-time-step integrators.},

abstract = {For samples with T 
                        1s longer than 10 s, calibration of the RF probe and a measurement of T 
                        1 can be very time-consuming. A technique is proposed for use in imaging applications where one wishes to rapidly obtain information about the RF flip angle and sample T 
                        1 prior to imaging. The flip angle measurement time is less than 1 s for a single scan. Prior knowledge of the RF flip angle is not required for the measurement of T 
                        1. The resulting time savings in measuring the values of flip angle and T 
                        1 are particularly significant in the case of samples with very long T 
                        1 and short T2*. An imaging extension of the technique provides RF flip angle mapping without the need for incrementing the pulse duration, i.e., RF mapping can be performed at fixed RF amplifier output. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The mathematical framework for turbulent transport in the ocean is reasonably well established. It may be applied to large-scale fields of scalars in the ocean and to the instantaneous or continuous discharge from a point. The theory and its physical basis can also provide an interpretation of passive scalar spectra. Spatial variations in the rate of turbulent transfer can be related to the movement of the center of mass of a scalar and to a formulation in terms of entrainment. The relative dispersion of a scalar with respect to its center of mass and the streakiness of the concentration field within the relative dispersion domain need to be considered. In many of these problems it is valuable to think in terms of simple models for individual streaks, as well as overall statistical properties. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The scattering of radiation from collimated irradiation is accurately treated via normalization of phase function. This approach is applicable to any numerical method with directional discretization. In this study it is applied to the transient discrete-ordinates method for ultrafast collimated radiative transfer analysis in turbid media. A technique recently developed by the authors, which conserves a phase-function asymmetry factor as well as scattered energy for the Henyey-Greenstein phase function in steady-state diffuse radiative transfer analysis, is applied to the general Legendre scattering phase function in ultrafast collimated radiative transfer. Heat flux profiles in a model tissue cylinder are generated for various phase functions and compared to those generated when normalization of the collimated phase function is neglected. Energy deposition in the medium is also investigated. Lack of conservation of scattered energy and the asymmetry factor for the collimated scattering phase function causes overpredictions in both heat flux and energy deposition for highly anisotropic scattering media. In addition, a discussion is presented to clarify the time-dependent formulation of divergence of radiative heat flux.},

abstract = {Mixing is relevant to many areas of science and engineering, including the pharmaceutical and food industries, oceanography, atmospheric sciences and civil engineering. In all these situations one goal is to quantify and often then to improve the degree of homogenization of a substance being stirred, referred to as a passive scalar or tracer. A classical measure of mixing is the variance of the concentration of the scalar, which is the L 2 norm of a mean-zero concentration field. Recently, other norms have been used to quantify mixing, in particular the mix-norm as well as negative Sobolev norms. These norms have the advantage that unlike variance they decay even in the absence of diffusion, and their decay corresponds to the flow being mixing in the sense of ergodic theory. General Sobolev norms weigh scalar gradients differently, and are known as multiscale norms for mixing. We review the applications of such norms to mixing and transport, and show how they can be used to optimize the stirring and mixing of a decaying passive scalar. We then review recent work on the less-studied case of a continuously replenished scalar field—the source–sink problem. In that case the flows that optimally reduce the norms are associated with transport rather than mixing: they push sources onto sinks, and vice versa.},

Nematic liquid crystal droplets self-propel in a surfactant solution with concentrations above the critical micelle concentration while undergoing micellar solubilization. We analyzed trajectories both in a Hele-Shaw geometry and in a 3D setup at variable buoyancy. The coupling between the nematic director field and the convective flow inside the droplet leads to a second symmetry breaking which gives rise to curling motion in 2D. This is demonstrated through a reversible transition to non-helical persistent swimming by heating to the isotropic phase. Furthermore, auto-chemotaxis can spontaneously break the inversion symmetry, leading to helical trajectories.},

It has been substantially enlarged to cover in a succinct manner a number of new topics, such as anomalous diffusion contiguous time random walks, stochastic resonance etc, which are of major current interest in view of the large number if disparate physical systems exhibiting these phenomena. The book has been written in such a way that all the material should be accessible than advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student. It draws together, in a coherent fashion, a variety of results which have hitherto been available only in the from of research papers or scattered review articles.},

We show that the results accumulated over the years inexorably lead to a unified framework for understanding proteins. The framework predicts the existence of a fixed menu of folds determined by geometry, clarifies the role of the amino acid sequence in selecting the native-state structure from this menu, and explains the propensity for amyloid formation. The experimental data and the new approach reveal an astonishing simplicity underlying the protein problem.},

Still, there are few publicly available research codes and, due to the heavy number crunching implied, available codes are usually written in low-level languages such as C/C++ or Fortran. In this paper we describe a pure scientific Python pseudo-spectral DNS code that nearly matches the performance of C++ for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the MPI domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been verified and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the KAUST supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores. A very important part of the implementation is the mesh decomposition (we implement both slab and pencil decompositions) and 3D parallel Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The mesh decomposition and FFT routines have been implemented in Python using serial FFT routines (either NumPy, pyFFTW or any other serial FFT module), NumPy array manipulations and with MPI communications handled by MPI for Python (mpi4py). We show how we are able to execute a 3D parallel FFT in Python for a slab mesh decomposition using 4 lines of compact Python code, for which the parallel performance on Shaheen is found to be slightly better than similar routines provided through the FFTW library. For a pencil mesh decomposition 7 lines of code is required to execute a transform.},

@article{Otto2013,
abstract = {We consider a model for phase separation in binary viscous liquids that allows for material transport due to cross-diffusion of unlike particles and convection by the hydrodynamic bulk flow. Typically, during the evolution, the average size of domains of the pure phases increases with time - a phenomenon called coarsening. Siggia [Eric D. Siggia, Phys. Rev. A, 20(2), 595-605, Aug. 1979] predicts that at an initial stage, coarsening proceeds mainly by diffusion, which leads to the well-known evaporation-recondensation growth law ℓ{\~{}}t1/3, when ℓ denotes the average domains size and t denotes time. Furthermore, he argued that at a later stage, convection by the bulk flow becomes the dominant transport mechanism, leading to a crossover in the coarsening rates to ℓ{\~{}}t. Siggia's predictions have been confirmed by experiments and numerical simulations. In this work, we prove the crossover in the coarsening rates in terms of time-averaged lower bounds on the energy, which scales like an inverse length. We use a method proposed by Kohn and the first author [Robert V. Kohn and Felix Otto, Commun. Math. Phys., 229(3), 375-395, 2002], which exploits the gradient flow structure of the dynamics. Our adaption uses techniques from optimal transportation. Our main ingredient is a dissipation inequality. It measures how the optimal transportation distance changes under the effects of convective and diffusive transport. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Press.},

abstract = {Evolution is the fundamental physical process that gives rise to biological phenomena. Yet it is widely treated as a subset of population genetics, and thus its scope is artificially limited. As a result, the key issues of how rapidly evolution occurs, and its coupling to ecology have not been satisfactorily addressed and formulated. The lack of widespread appreciation for, and understanding of, the evolutionary process has arguably retarded the development of biology as a science, with disastrous consequences for its applications to medicine, ecology and the global environment. This review focuses on evolution as a problem in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, where the key dynamical modes are collective, as evidenced by the plethora of mobile genetic elements whose role in shaping evolution has been revealed by modern genomic surveys. We discuss how condensed matter physics concepts might provide a useful perspective in evolutionary biology, the conceptual failings of the modern evolutionary synthesis, the open-ended growth of complexity, and the quintessentially self-referential nature of evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {The use of encapsulated liquid nanoparticles is currently largely investigated for medical applications, mainly because their reduced size allows them to enter targeted areas which cannot be reached by large microbubbles (contrast agents). Low-boiling point perfluorocarbon droplets can be vaporized on-site under the action of the ultrasonic field, in order to turn them into echogeneous—eventually cavitating—microbubbles. This paper presents a theoretical model describing this phenomenon, paying particular attention to the finite size of the droplet and its encapsulation by a thin viscoelastic layer. Numerical simulations are done for droplets of radii 1 and 10 $\mu$m and for frequencies of 1–5 MHz. Results reveal that dropletsurface tension and shell rigidity are responsible for an increase of the acoustic dropletvaporization threshold. Furthermore, this threshold does not vary monotonically with frequency, and an optimal frequency can be found to minimize it. Finally, the role of some physical properties on the dynamics of the particle is analyzed, such as the contrast of inner and outer liquids densities and the mechanical properties of the shell.},

abstract = {The mixing efficiency of a flow advecting a passive scalar sustained by steady sources and sinks is naturally defined in terms of the suppression of bulk scalar variance in the presence of stirring, relative to the variance in the absence of stirring. These variances can be weighted at various spatial scales, leading to a family of multi-scale mixing measures and efficiencies. We derive a priori estimates on these efficiencies from the advection-diffusion partial differential equation, focusing on a broad class of statistically homogeneous and isotropic incompressible flows. The analysis produces bounds on the mixing efficiencies in terms of the P{\'{e}}clet number, a measure of the strength of the stirring relative to molecular diffusion. We show by example that the estimates are sharp for particular source, sink and flow combinations. In general the high-P{\'{e}}clet-number behavior of the bounds (scaling exponents as well as prefactors) depends on the structure and smoothness properties of, and length scales in, the scalar source and sink distribution. The fundamental model of the stirring of a monochromatic source/sink combination by the random sine flow is investigated in detail via direct numerical simulation and analysis. The large-scale mixing efficiency follows the upper bound scaling (within a logarithm) at high P{\'{e}}clet number but the intermediate and small-scale efficiencies are qualitatively less than optimal. The P{\'{e}}clet number scaling exponents of the efficiencies observed in the simulations are deduced theoretically from the asymptotic solution of an internal layer problem arising in a quasi-static model. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Tikhonov regularization (TIKR) has been demonstrated as a powerful and valuable method for the determination of distance distributions of spin-pairs in bi-labeled biomolecules directly from pulsed ESR signals. TIKR is a direct method, which requires no iteration, and, therefore, provides a rapid and unique solution. However, the distribution obtained tends to exhibit oscillatory excursions with negative portions in the presence of finite noise, especially in the peripheral regions of the distribution. The Shannon-Jaynes entropy of a probability distribution provides an intrinsic non-negativity constraint on the probability distribution and an unbiased way of obtaining information from incomplete data. We describe how the maximum entropy regularization method (MEM) may be applied to solve the ill-posed nature of the dipolar signal in pulsed ESR. We make use of it to suppress the negative excursions of the distance distribution and to increase the tolerance to noise in the dipolar signal. Model studies and experimental data are investigated, and they show that, with the initial or "seed" probability distribution that is required for MEM taken as the TIKR result, then MEM is able to provide a regularized solution, subject to the non-negativity constraint, and it is effective in dealing with noise that is problematic for TIKR. In addition we have incorporated into our MEM method the ability to extract the intermolecular dipolar component, which is embedded in the raw experimental data. We find that MEM minimization, which is implemented iteratively, is greatly accelerated using the TIKR result as the seed, and it converges more successfully. Thus we regard the MEM method as a complement to TIKR by securing a positive pair distance distribution and enhancing the accuracy of TIKR. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Geometric confinement plays an important role in the dynamics of natural and synthetic microswimmers from bacterial cells to self-propelled particles in high-throughput microfluidic devices. However, little is known about the effects of geometric confinement on the emergent global patterns in such self-propelled systems. Recent experiments on bacterial cells give conflicting reports of cells spontaneously organizing into a spiral vortex in a thin cylindrical droplet and cells aggregating at the inner boundary in a spherical droplet. We investigate here, in an idealized physical model, the interplay between geometric confinement and level of flagellar activity on the emergent collective patterns. We show that decreasing flagellar activity induces a hydrodynamically-triggered transition in confined microswimmers from swirling to global circulation (vortex) to boundary aggregation and clustering. These results highlight that the complex interplay between confinement, flagellar activity and hydrodynamic flows in concentrated suspensions of microswimmers could lead to a plethora of global patterns that are difficult to predict from geometric consideration alone.},

abstract = {Tight coupling between biochemical and mechanical properties of the actin cytoskeleton drives a large range of cellular processes including polarity establishment, morphogenesis, and motility. This is possible because actin filaments are semi-flexible polymers that, in conjunction with the molecular motor myosin, can act as biological active springs or "dashpots" (in laymen's terms, shock absorbers or fluidizers) able to exert or resist against force in a cellular environment. To modulate their mechanical properties, actin filaments can organize into a variety of architectures generating a diversity of cellular organizations including branched or crosslinked networks in the lamellipodium, parallel bundles in filopodia, and antiparallel structures in contractile fibers. In this review we describe the feedback loop between biochemical and mechanical properties of actin organization at the molecular level in vitro, then we integrate this knowledge into our current understanding of cellular actin organization and its physiological roles.},

abstract = {The Conjugate Gradient Method is the most prominent iterative method for solving sparse systems of linear equations. Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition, and their victims can be found to this day babbling senselessly in the corners of dusty libraries. For this reason, a deep, geometric understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-six illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several differentways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},

abstract = {This textbook presents an exposition of stochastic dynamics and irreversibility. It comprises the principles of probability theory and the stochastic dynamics in continuous spaces, described by Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations, and in discrete spaces, described by Markov chains and master equations. Special concern is given to the study of irreversibility, both in systems that evolve to equilibrium and in nonequilibrium stationary states. Attention is also given to the study of models displaying phase transitions and critical phenomena both in thermodynamic equilibrium and out of equilibrium.These models include the linear Glauber model, the Glauber-Ising model, lattice models with absorbing states such as the contact process and those used in population dynamic and spreading of epidemic, probabilistic cellular automata, reaction-diffusion processes, random sequential adsorption and dynamic percolation. A stochastic approach to chemical reaction is also presented.The textbook is intended for students of physics and chemistry and for those interested in stochastic dynamics.It provides, by means of examples and problems, a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the theory and its applications.},

A key idea here is the use of the normal metric to define the kinetic energy. This leads to Hamiltonian flows of the double bracket type. We analyze the integrability of geodesic flows according to the method of Thimm. We obtain via the double bracket formalism a quite explicit form of the relevant commuting flows and a correspondingly transparent proof of involutivity. We demonstrate for example integrability of the geodesic flow on the real and complex Grassmannians. We also consider right invariant systems and the generalized rigid body equations in this setting.},

Rev. Lett. 79, 3644 (1997)]. In this paper, the statistical distribution of the random variable X=straight theta/sqrt[{\textless}straight theta(2){\textgreater}] is investigated analytically for the scaling in two limits, n-independent scaling zeta(2n)=zeta(2) and regular scaling zeta(2n)=nzeta(2), and numerically for the scaling of the Kraichnan conjecture zeta(2n)=1 / 2[sqrt[4ndzeta(2)+(d-zeta(2))(2)]-(d-zeta(2))]. For n-independent scaling zeta(2n)=zeta(2), the statistical distribution of X tends to an exponential distribution when zeta(2)--{\textgreater}0 or d--{\textgreater}infinity and to a Gaussian distribution when zeta(2)--{\textgreater}2 and d=2. For regular scaling zeta(2n)=nzeta(2), the statistical distribution of X tends to a Gaussian distribution when zeta(2)--{\textgreater}0 or d--{\textgreater}infinity. In d=2, there seems to be a phase transition for the probability density function P(X) from a convex to a concave function when the value of zeta(2) is increased and the critical point is zeta(2)=4/3 where the random variable X has a uniform distribution in [-sqrt[3],sqrt[3]]. In d=3, P(X) is a convex function for all 0{\textless}zeta(2){\textless}2 and tends to a constant on its support [-sqrt[3],sqrt[3]] when zeta(2)--{\textgreater}2. For the scaling of the Kraichnan conjecture, P(X) has two peaks in d=2 for zeta(2){\textgreater}1.33, but, in d=3, it has only one peak for all 0{\textless}zeta(2){\textless}2 and changes very slowly with the value of X in the neighborhood of X=0 as zeta(2)--{\textgreater}2.},

abstract = {In this review we summarize theoretical progress in the field of active matter, placing it in the context of recent experiments. Our approach offers a unified framework for the mechanical and statistical properties of living matter: biofilaments and molecular motors in vitro or in vivo, collections of motile microorganisms, animal flocks, and chemical or mechanical imitations. A major goal of the review is to integrate the several approaches proposed in the literature, from semi-microscopic to phenomenological. In particular, we first consider "dry" systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to friction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium, and clarify the differences and similarities between two types of orientationally ordered states, the nematic and the polar. We then consider the active hydrodynamics of a suspension, and relate as well as contrast it with the dry case. We further highlight various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter. We discuss and connect various semi-microscopic derivations of the continuum theory, highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum model. Throughout the review, we discuss the experimental relevance of these theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of living cells, and vibrated granular materials. We suggest promising extensions towards greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to ethology, and remark on some exotic active-matter analogues. Lastly, we summarize the outlook for a quantitative understanding of active matter, through the interplay of detailed theory with controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living or artificial constituents.},

abstract = {The past twenty years have seen a resurgence of interest in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, thanks to advances in the theory of stochastic processes and in their thermodynamic interpretation. Fluctuation theorems provide fundamental constraints on the dynamics of systems arbitrarily far from thermal equilibrium. Thermodynamic uncertainty relations bound the dissipative cost of precision in a wide variety of processes. Concepts of excess work and excess heat provide the basis for a complete thermodynamics of nonequilibrium steady states, including generalized Clausius relations and thermodynamic potentials. But these general results carry their own limitations: fluctuation theorems involve exponential averages that can depend sensitively on unobservably rare trajectories; steady-state thermodynamics makes use of a dual dynamics that lacks any direct physical interpretation. This review aims to present these central results of contemporary nonequilibrium thermodynamics in such a way that the power of each claim for making physical predictions can be clearly assessed, using examples from current topics in soft matter and biophysics.},

abstract = {Calls for the adoption of complex systems approaches, including agent-based modeling, in the field of epidemiology have largely centered on the potential for such methods to examine complex disease etiologies, which are characterized by feedback behavior, interference, threshold dynamics, and multiple interacting causal effects. However, considerable theoretical and practical issues impede the capacity of agent-based methods to examine and evaluate causal effects and thus illuminate new areas for intervention. We build on this work by describing how agent-based models can be used to simulate counterfactual outcomes in the presence of complexity. We show that these models are of particular utility when the hypothesized causal mechanisms exhibit a high degree of interdependence between multiple causal effects and when interference (i.e., one person's exposure affects the outcome of others) is present and of intrinsic scientific interest. Although not without challenges, agent-based modeling (and complex systems methods broadly) represent a promising novel approach to identify and evaluate complex causal effects, and they are thus well suited to complement other modern epidemiologic methods of etiologic inquiry.},

abstract = {The objective was to determine whether a transpulmonary droplet emulsion (90{\%}, {\textless}6 microm diameter) could be used to form large gas bubbles ({\textgreater}30 microm) temporarily in vivo. Such bubbles could occlude a targeted capillary bed when used in a large number density. Alternatively, for a very sparse population of droplets, the resulting gas bubbles could serve as point beacons for phase aberration corrections in ultrasonic imaging. Gas bubbles can be made in vivo by acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) of injected, superheated, dodecafluoropentane droplets. Droplets vaporize in an acoustic field whose peak rarefactional pressure exceeds a well-defined threshold. In this new work, it has been found that intraarterial and intravenous injections can be used to introduce the emulsion into the blood stream for subsequent ADV (B- and M-mode on a clinical scanner) in situ. Intravenous administration results in a lower gas bubble yield, possibly because of filtering in the lung, dilution in the blood volume, or other circulatory effects. Results show that for occlusion purposes, a reduction in regional blood flow of 34{\%} can be achieved. Individual point beacons with a +24 dB backscatter amplitude relative to white matter were created by intravenous injection and ADV.},

abstract = {Nonequilibrium physics encompasses a broad range of natural and synthetic small-scale systems. Optimizing transitions of such systems will be crucial for the development of nanoscale technologies and may reveal the physical principles underlying biological processes at the molecular level. Recent work has demonstrated that when a thermodynamic system is driven away from equilibrium then the space of controllable parameters has a Riemannian geometry induced by a generalized inverse diffusion tensor. We derive a simple, compact expression for the inverse diffusion tensor that depends solely on equilibrium information for a broad class of potentials. We use this formula to compute the minimal dissipation for two model systems relevant to small-scale information processing and biological molecular motors. In the first model, we optimally erase a single classical bit of information modelled by an overdamped particle in a smooth double-well potential. In the second model, we find the minimal dissipation of a simple molecular motor model coupled to an optical trap. In both models, we find that the minimal dissipation for the optimal protocol of duration $\tau$ is proportional to 1/$\tau$ , as expected, though the dissipation for the erasure model takes a different form than what we found previously for a similar system.},

abstract = {The hair follicle system represents a tractable model for the study of stem cell behaviour in regenerative adult epithelial tissue. However, although there are numerous spatial scales of observation (molecular, cellular, follicle and multi follicle), it is not yet clear what mechanisms underpin the follicle growth cycle. In this study we seek to address this problem by describing how the growth dynamics of a large population of follicles can be treated as a classical excitable medium. Defining caricature interactions at the molecular scale and treating a single follicle as a functional unit, a minimal model is proposed in which the follicle growth cycle is an emergent phenomenon. Expressions are derived, in terms of parameters representing molecular regulation, for the time spent in the different functional phases of the cycle, a formalism that allows the model to be directly compared with a previous cellular automaton model and experimental measurements made at the single follicle scale. A multi follicle model is constructed and numerical simulations are used to demonstrate excellent qualitative agreement with a range of experimental observations. Notably, the excitable medium equations exhibit a wider family of solutions than the previous work and we demonstrate how parameter changes representing altered molecular regulation can explain perturbed patterns in Wnt over-expression and BMP down-regulation mouse models. Further experimental scenarios that could be used to test the fundamental premise of the model are suggested. The key conclusion from our work is that positive and negative regulatory interactions between activators and inhibitors can give rise to a range of experimentally observed phenomena at the follicle and multi follicle spatial scales and, as such, could represent a core mechanism underlying hair follicle growth.},

abstract = {An approach that enables the acquisition of multidimensional NMR spectra within a single scan has been recently proposed and demonstrated. The present paper explores the applicability of such ultrafast acquisition schemes toward the collection of two-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (2D MRI) data. It is shown that ideas enabling the application of these spatially encoded schemes within a spectroscopic setting, can be extended in a straightforward manner to pure imaging. Furthermore, the reliance of the original scheme on a spatial encoding and subsequent decoding of the evolution frequencies endows imaging applications with a greater simplicity and flexibility than their spectroscopic counterparts. The new methodology also offers the possibility of implementing the single-scan acquisition of 2D MRI images using sinusoidal gradients, without having to resort to subsequent interpolation procedures or non-linear sampling of the data. Theoretical derivations on the operational principles and imaging characteristics of a number of sequences based on these ideas are derived, and experimentally validated with a series of 2D MRI results collected on a variety of model phantom samples. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We mainly focus here on those results that had or will have some impact on the fluid-dynamics community. In particular, we address the problem of small-scale intermittency by discussing energy–helicity interactions, energy-dissipation multifractality, and universality of intermittency, i.e., independence of anomalous scaling exponents from large-scale forcing and boundary conditions. A multifractal-based description of multiscale and multitime correlation functions in turbulence is also presented. Finally, we also briefly review the analytical difficulties, and hopes, of calculating anomalous exponents.},

All constants are independent of the dimension, and optimal in certain cases.

@article{Hohenegger2010,
abstract = {We study theoretically the stability of "active suspensions," modeled here as a Stokesian fluid in which are suspended motile particles. The basis of our study is a kinetic model recently posed by Saintillan and Shelley [D. Saintillan and M. J. Shelley, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 178103 (2008); D. Saintillan and M. J. Shelley, Phys. Fluids 20, 123304 (2008)] where the motile particles are either "pushers" or "pullers." General considerations suggest that, in the absence of diffusional processes, perturbations from uniform isotropy will decay for pullers, but grow unboundedly for pushers, suggesting a possible ill-posedness. Hence, we investigate the structure of this system linearized near a state of uniform isotropy. The linearized system is nonnormal and variable coefficient, and not wholly described by an eigenvalue problem, in particular at small length scales. Using a high wave-number asymptotic analysis, we show that while long-wave stability depends on the particular swimming mechanism, short-wave stability does not and that the growth of perturbations for pusher suspensions is associated not with concentration fluctuations, as we show these generally decay, but with a proliferation of oscillations in swimmer orientation. These results are also confirmed through numerical simulation and suggest that the basic model is well-posed, even in the absence of translational and rotational diffusion effects. We also consider the influence of diffusional effects in the case where the rotational and translational diffusion coefficients are proportional and inversely proportional, respectively, to the volume concentration and predict the existence of a critical volume concentration or system size for the onset of the long-wave instability in a pusher suspension. We find reasonable agreement between the predictions of our theory and numerical simulations of rodlike swimmers by Saintillan and Shelley [D. Saintillan and M. J. Shelley, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 058102 (2007)].},

@article{Batchelor1952,
abstract = {A material line consisting always of the same particles of fluid is lengthened by the con- vective action of turbulent motion, at a rate which is shown to be exponential at a sufficient time after the initial choice of the line. The area of material surface elements also increases exponentially, although with a different exponential coefficient. It is then a consequence of conservation of mass of the fluid that the normal distance between two neighbouring parallel material surfaces decreases at an exponential rate which is simply related to the rate at which material lines lengthen. These kinematical results are relevant to the convective action of the turbulence on the distribution of two kinds of local property of the fluid, viz. quantities, represented by 0, of which the total amount in a material volume of the fluid remains constant (e.g. mass density of a foreign substance), and quantities, represented by F, of which the total flux across a material surface remains constant (e.g. vorticity). F is proportional, at all times, to the vector representing a material line element and G, = VO, is proportional to the vector representing a material surface element, and hence they both increase exponentially in time. The last two sections of the paper are concerned with the combined effect on F and G of convection and molecular diffusion, and a condition for the effect of the convection to be dominant is obtained. In the case of F, convection is found to be dominant if the appropriate molecular diffusivity is small compared with the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and F2 will then increase indefinitely, unless some additional effect comes into play (as it does in the case of magnetic field strength). In the case of G, convection will be dominant if the initial distribution of G has a large enough length scale; the effect of the convection is to decrease this length scale so that ultimately the two effects reach an equilibrium. The length scale of the ultimate distribution of G, as obtained herein, is different from that put forward recently by Obukhoff.},

But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

abstract = {The effect of mechanical interactions between cells in the spreading of bacterial populations was investigated in one-dimensional space. A continuum-mechanics approach, comprising cell migration, proliferation, and exclusion processes, was employed to elucidate the dynamics. The consequent nonlinear reaction-diffusion-like equation describes the constitution dynamics of a bacterial population. In this model, bacterial cells were treated as rod-like particles that interact with each other through hard-core repulsion, which introduces the exclusion effect that causes bacterial populations to migrate quickly at high density. The propagation of bacterial density as a traveling wave front over extended times was also analyzed. The analytical and numerical solutions revealed that the front speed was enhanced by the exclusion process, which depended upon the cell-packing fraction. Finally, we qualitatively compared our theoretical results with experimental evidence.},

abstract = {Since the publication of "Spectral Methods in Fluid Dynamics", spectral methods, particularly in their multidomain version, have become firmly established as a mainstream tool for scientific and engineering computation. While retaining the tight integration between the theoretical and practical aspects of spectral methods that was the hallmark of the earlier book, Canuto et al. now incorporate the many improvements in the algorithms and the theory of spectral methods that have been made since 1988.The initial treatment Fundamentals in Single Domains discusses the fundamentals of the approximation of solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations on single domains by expansions in smooth, global basis functions. The first half of the book provides the algorithmic details of orthogonal expansions, transform methods, spectral discretization of differential equations plus their boundary conditions, and solution of the discretized equations by direct and iterative methods. The second half furnishes a comprehensive discussion of the mathematical theory of spectral methods on single domains, including approximation theory, stability and convergence, and illustrative applications of the theory to model boundary-value problems. Both the algorithmic and theoretical discussions cover spectral methods on tensor-product domains, triangles and tetrahedra. All chapters are enhanced with material on the Galerkin with numerical integration version of spectral methods. The discussion of direct and iterative solution methods is greatly expanded as are the set of numerical examples that illustrate the key properties of the various types of spectral approximations and the solution algorithms. A companion book "Evolution to Complex Geometries and Applications to Fluid Dynamics" contains an extensive survey of the essential algorithmic and theoretical aspects of spectral methods for complex geometries and provides detailed discussions of spectral algorithms for fluid dynamics in simple and complex geometries.},

High speed video microscopy was used to monitor droplets in a flow tube, while a focused, single element transducer operating at 3, 4, or 10 MHz was aimed at the intersection of the acoustical and optical beams. A highly dilute droplet emulsion was injected, and individual droplets were positioned in the two foci. Phase transitions of droplets were produced by rarefactional pressures as low as 4 MPa at 3 MHz using single, 3.25 micros tone bursts. During acoustic irradiation, droplets showed dipole-type oscillations along the acoustic axis (average amplitude 1.3 microm, independent of droplet diameter which ranged from 5 to 27 microm). The onset of vaporization was monitored as either spot-like, within the droplet, or homogeneous, throughout the droplet's imaged cross section. Spot-like centers of nucleation were observed solely along the axis lying parallel to the direction of oscillation and centered on the droplet. Smaller droplets required more acoustic intensity for vaporization than larger droplets, which is consistent with other experiments on emulsions.},

abstract = {We present direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the mixing of the passive scalar at modest Reynolds numbers (10 Rlambda 42) and Schmidt numbers larger than unity (2 Sc 32). The simulations resolve below the Batchelor scale up to a factor of four. The advecting turbulence is homogeneous and isotropic, and maintained stationary by stochastic forcing at low wavenumbers. The passive scalar is rendered stationary by a mean scalar gradient in one direction. The relation between geometrical and statistical properties of scalar field and its gradients is examined. The Reynolds numbers and Schmidt numbers are not large enough for either the Kolmogorov scaling or the Batchelor scaling to develop and, not surprisingly, we find no fractal scaling of scalar level sets, or isosurfaces, in the intermediate viscous range. The area-to-volume ratio of isosurfaces reflects the nearly Gaussian statistics of the scalar fluctuations. The scalar flux across the isosurfaces, which is determined by the conditional probability density function (PDF) of the scalar gradient magnitude, has a stretched exponential distribution towards the tails. The PDF of the scalar dissipation departs distinctly, for both small and large amplitudes, from the lognormal distribution for all cases considered. The joint statistics of the scalar and its dissipation rate, and the mean conditional moment of the scalar dissipation, are studied as well. We examine the effects of coarse-graining on the probability density to simulate the effects of poor probe-resolution in measurements.},

In the field of ultrasound, phase-change droplets present an attractive alternative to traditional microbubble agents for many diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Despite the progress, phase-change PFC droplets remain far from clinical implementation due to a number of challenges. In this review, we survey our recent work to enhance the performance of phase-change agents for ultrasound through a variety of techniques in order to provide increased efficacy in therapeutic applications of ultrasound and enable previously unexplored applications in diagnostic and molecular imaging.},

We account for interaction with the external medium by imposing a viscous friction at the fixed droplet boundary. We then show that the droplet has non-zero force dipole and quadrupole moments, the latter of which is essential for self-propelled motion of the droplet at low Reynolds' number. Therefore, this calculation describes a simple mechanism for the motility of a droplet of active contractile fluid embedded in a three-dimensional environment, which is relevant to cell migration in confinement (for example, embedded within a gel or tissue). Our analytical results predict how the system depends on various parameters such as the effective friction coefficient, the phenomenological activity parameter and the splay of the imposed polarisation.},

In recent years it has been realized that such distributions encode surprisingly more information than one might expect from traditional thermodynamic arguments.

abstract = {Mixing is relevant to many areas of science and engineering, including the pharmaceutical and food industries, oceanography, atmospheric sciences, and civil engineering. In all these situations one goal is to quantify and often then to improve the degree of homogenisation of a substance being stirred, referred to as a passive scalar or tracer. A classical measure of mixing is the variance of the concentration of the scalar, which can be related to the {\$}L{\^{}}2{\$} norm of the concentration field. Recently other norms have been used to quantify mixing, in particular the mix-norm as well as negative Sobolev norms. These norms have the advantage that unlike variance they decay even in the absence of diffusion, and their decay corresponds to the flow being mixing in the sense of ergodic theory. General Sobolev norms weigh scalar gradients differently, and are known as multiscale norms for mixing. We review the applications of such norms to mixing and transport, and show how they can be used to optimise the stirring and mixing of a decaying passive scalar. We then review recent work on the less-studied case of a continuously-replenished scalar field --- the source-sink problem. In that case the flows that optimally reduce the norms are associated with transport rather than mixing: they push sources onto sinks, and vice versa.},

Unlike passive systems in thermal equilibrium, active matter systems are not constrained by conventional thermodynamic laws. A question arises, however, as to what extent, if any, can concepts from classical thermodynamics be applied to nonequilibrium systems like active matter. Here we use the new swim pressure perspective to develop a simple theory for predicting phase separation in active matter. Using purely mechanical arguments we generate a phase diagram with a spinodal and critical point, and define a nonequilibrium chemical potential to interpret the " binodal. " We provide a generalization of thermodynamic concepts like the free energy and temperature for nonequilibrium active systems. Our theory agrees with existing simulation data both qualitatively and quantitatively and may provide a framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of nonequilibrium active systems.},

Both, a first-law like energy balance involving exchanged heat and entropy production entering refinements of the second law can consistently be defined along single stochastic trajectories. Various exact relations involving the distribution of such quantities like integral and detailed fluctuation theorems for total entropy production and the Jarzynski relation follow from such an approach based on Langevin dynamics. Analogues of these relations can be proven for any system obeying a stochastic master equation like, in particular, (bio)chemically driven enzyms or whole reaction networks. The perspective of investigating such relations for stochastic field equations like the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation is sketched as well.},

abstract = {In this work we investigate a technique for accelerating convergence of adjoint-based optimization of PDE systems based on a nonlinear change of variables in the control space. This change of variables is accomplished in the "differentiate - then - discretize" approach by constructing the descent directions in a control space not equipped with the Hilbert structure. We show how such descent directions can be computed in general Lebesgue and Besov spaces, and argue that in the Besov space case determination of descent directions can be interpreted as nonlinear wavelet filtering of the adjoint field. The freedom involved in choosing parameters characterizing the spaces in which the steepest descent directions are constructed can be leveraged to accelerate convergence of iterations. Our computational examples involving state estimation problems for the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and 3D Navier-Stokes equations indeed show significantly improved performance of the proposed method as compared to the standard approaches. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Tumor accumulation of nanoemulsions was confirmed by ultrasound imaging. Dramatic regression of ovarian, breast, and orthotopic pancreatic tumors was observed in tumor therapy through systemic injections of drug-loaded nanoemulsions combined with therapeutic ultrasound, signifying efficient ultrasound-triggered drug release from tumor-accumulated nanodroplets. The mechanism of drug release in the process of droplet-to-bubble conversion is discussed. No therapeutic effect from the nanodroplet/ultrasound combination was observed without the drug, indicating that therapeutic effect was caused by the ultrasound-enhanced chemotherapeutic action of the tumor-targeted drug, rather than the mechanical or thermal action of ultrasound itself. Tumor recurrence was observed after the completion of the first treatment round; a second treatment round with the same regimen proved less effective, suggesting that drug-resistant cells were either developed or selected during the first treatment round. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Systems at equilibrium like molecular or colloidal suspensions have a well-defined thermal energy kBT that quantifies the particles' kinetic energy and gauges how “hot” or “cold” the system is. For systems far from equilibrium, such as active matter, it is unclear whether the concept of a “temperature” exists and whether self-propelled entities are capable of thermally equilibrating like passive Brownian suspensions. Here we develop a simple mechanical theory to study the phase behavior and “temperature” of a mixture of self-propelled particles. A mixture of active swimmers and passive Brownian particles is an ideal system for discovery of the temperature of active matter and the quantities that get shared upon particle collisions. We derive an explicit equation of state for the active/passive mixture to compute a phase diagram and to generalize thermodynamic concepts like the chemical potential and free energy for a mixture of nonequilibrium species. We find that different stability criteria predict in general different phase boundaries, facilitating considerations in simulations and experiments about which ensemble of variables are held fixed and varied.},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. The methods were orginally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-progagation problems, particulary in heterogenous material. The methods studied are in the CLAWPACK software package. Source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},

By contrast, nonequilibrium phenomena are diverse with typically non-Gaussian, non-local fluctuations, making them challenging to characterize. Nevertheless, we prove that the steady-state current fluctuations in nonequilibrium Markov jump processes can be simply bounded using the dissipation as in linear response. Thus, nonequilibrium fluctuations are always more likely than what one would have expected from a linear response analysis. As a small-fluctuation corollary, we derive a recently-conjectured uncertainty bound on the variance of the current fluctuations.},

Due to the nonlinearity of the governing equation, the transient growth rate of the mixing layer is nonfractal even for a fractal velocity field. For a velocity field with an exponentially decaying correlation function, the comparisons of the exact results under Corrsin's approximation with the results from the linear and quasi-linear theories are presented. The results from Corrsin's hypothesis show that for an exponentially decaying correlation function with variance s, the longitudinal asymptotic dispersion coefficient is proportional to s2 for small values of s and proportional to s for large values of s.

The well known nonequilibrium relations, the Jarzynski equality and the fluctuation theorem, share the mathematical structure with the above equalities. This hidden common property motivates us to extend the Jarzynski equality to a relation applicable in the generalized dynamical system. As a result, we find several equalities which are able to be established in this generalized system described by the Langevin equation. These results easily reproduce the SpeckSeifert equality and the HatanoSasa equality. We hope that our formulation gives a new insight on nonequilibrium statistical physics. ?? 2010 ElsevierB.V.

abstract = {Information processing machines at the nanoscales are unavoidably affected by thermal fluctuations. Efficient design requires understanding how nanomachines can operate at minimal energy dissipation. In this letter we focus on mechanical systems controlled by smoothly varying potential forces. We show that optimal control equations come about in a natural way if the energy cost to manipulate the potential is taken into account. When such cost becomes negligible, the optimal control strategy can be constructed by transparent geometrical methods and recovers the solution of optimal mass transport equations in the overdamped limit. Our equations are equivalent to hierarchies of kinetic equations of a form well-known in the theory of dilute gases. From our results, optimal strategies for energy efficient nanosystems may be devised},

Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion of the various facets of this highly multidisciplinary field, including experiments, mathematical methods and models for simulations, so that readers with a variety of background could get both the basics and a broader, more detailed picture of the field. The observations we report on include systems consisting of units ranging from macromolecules through metallic rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and algebraic divergences. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Essentially all biology is active and dynamic. Biological entities autonomously sense, com- pute, and respond using energy-coupled ratchets that can produce force and do work. The cytoskeleton, along with its associated proteins and motors, is a canonical example of biological active matter, which is responsible for cargo transport, cell motility, division, and morphol- ogy. Prior work on cytoskeletal active matter systems showed either extensile or contractile dynamics. Here, we demonstrate a cytoskeletal system that can control the direction of the network dynamics to be either extensile, contractile, or static depending on the concentration of filaments or transient crosslinkers through systematic variation of the crosslinker or micro- tubule concentrations. Based off these new observations and our previously published results, we created a simple one-dimensional model of the interaction of filaments within a bundle. Despite its simplicity, our model recapitulates the observed activities of our experimental sys- tem, implying that the dynamics of our finite networks of bundles are driven by the local filament-filament interactions within the bundle.

abstract = {Several implications of well-known fluctuation theorems, on the statistical properties of entropy production, are studied using various approaches. We begin by deriving a tight lower bound on the variance of the entropy production for a given mean of this random variable. It is shown that the Evans–Searles fluctuation theorem alone imposes a significant lower bound on the variance only when the mean entropy production is very small. It is then nonetheless demonstrated that upon incorporating additional information concerning the entropy production, this lower bound can be significantly improved, so as to capture extensivity properties. Another important aspect of the fluctuation properties of the entropy production is the relationship between the mean and the variance, on the one hand, and the probability of the event where the entropy production is negative, on the other hand. Accordingly, we derive upper and lower bounds on this probability in terms of the mean and the variance. These bounds are tighter than previous bounds that can be found in the literature. Moreover, they are tight in the sense that there exist probability distributions, satisfying the Evans–Searles fluctuation theorem, that achieve them with equality. Finally, we present a general method for generating a wide class of inequalities that must be satisfied by the entropy production. We use this method to derive several new inequalities that go beyond the standard derivation of the second law.},

An application to rock-scissors-paper game interactions shows that the collective learning dynamics exhibits a diversity of competitive and cooperative behaviors.

The anomalous scaling exponents H(p) of passive scalar advected by these two kinds of random velocities above are determined for structure function with values of p up to 15 by Monte Carlo simulations of the random shell model, with Gear methods used to solve the stochastic differential equations. We find that the H(p) advected by the non-Gaussian random velocity is not more anomalous than that advected by the Gaussian random velocity. Whether the advecting velocity is non-Gaussian or Gaussian, similar scaling exponents of passive scalar are obtained with the same molecular diffusivity.},

At first, the concept, models and research methods of emergent computation are introduced and stated. Furthermore, the layout design problems in complex engineering systems and the collective behaviour issues in complex social systems are chosen as representatives to expand the review. The generation mechanisms of emergent computation in engineering systems are expounded and the emergent computation models of collective behaviour which include synchronisation and public opinion propagation are discussed. Based on the review of research status, further analysis on the existed problems and shortcomings is made and some perspectives on the development trends of future research which relate to emergent computation of complex systems are provided. {\textcopyright} 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion of the various facets of this highly multidisciplinary field, including experiments, mathematical methods and models for simulations, so that readers with a variety of background could get both the basics and a broader, more detailed picture of the field. The observations we report on include systems consisting of units ranging from macromolecules through metallic rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and algebraic divergences. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, we present an alternative membrane-free model, which demonstrates that low-molecular-weight mononucleotides and simple cationic peptides spontaneously accumulate in water into microdroplets that are stable to changes in temperature and salt concentration, undergo pH-induced cycles of growth and decay, and promote $\alpha$-helical peptide secondary structure. Moreover, the microdroplets selectively sequester porphyrins, inorganic nanoparticles and enzymes to generate supramolecular stacked arrays of light-harvesting molecules, nanoparticle-mediated oxidase activity, and enhanced rates of glucose phosphorylation, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest that peptide-nucleotide microdroplets can be considered as a new type of protocell model that could be used to develop novel bioreactors, primitive artificial cells and plausible pathways to prebiotic organization before the emergence of lipid-based compartmentalization on the early Earth.},

abstract = {This study was undertaken to measure the ultrasound (US)-mediated cavitation threshold of microdroplets as a function of its content and US parameters (frequency, amplitude and burst length). Albumin-coated droplets were prepared with perfluoropropane, perfluorohexane or perfluoromethylcyclohexane contents. The filtered suspensions were diluted to 1:1000 (v) and compared with Optison". The formulations were injected into an acoustically transparent vessel and sonicated with a single focused transducer. The frequencies employed were 0.74, 1.1, 2.18 and 3.3 MHz and the burst length and acoustic pressure were varied. The inertial cavitation threshold for each experiment was monitored through passive acoustic detection. The formation of droplet emulsion of the perfluorocarbon increased the natural boiling point of the perfluorocarbon. However, perfluorocarbon droplets having contents with higher molecular weights and boiling points did not have detectably higher inertial cavitation thresholds and, thus, the droplets do not need to be in a superheated state to be cavitated by US bursts. Therefore, higher boiling point perfluorocarbons should be investigated for this purpose and may prove to be useful for both imaging and therapy. The inertial cavitation threshold of perfluorocarbon droplets increases with frequency, and was approximately 0.7 MPa at 0.74 MHz and 1.75 MPa at 3.3 MHz. Optison", already in a gaseous state, has the lowest cavitation threshold of all formulations studied. Results show that, for the frequencies tested, there is no dependence between inertial cavitation threshold and burst lengths between 20 and 100 ms. As a conclusion, the inertial cavitation threshold of albumin-coated microdroplets of several perfluorocarbons was determined in vitro. The results indicate that the physical properties of these droplets are such that they may be useful for localized US therapies. ?? 2003 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine {\&} Biology.},

abstract = {All living things exhibit adaptations that enable them to survive and reproduce in the natural environment that they inhabit. From a biological standpoint, it has long been understood that adaptation comes from natural selection, whereby maladapted individuals do not pass their traits effectively to future generations. However, we may also consider the phenomenon of adaptation from the standpoint of physics, and ask whether it is possible to delineate what the difference is in terms of physical properties between something that is well-adapted to its surrounding environment, and something that is not. In this work, we undertake to address this question from a theoretical standpoint. Building on past fundamental results in far-from-equilibrium statistical mechanics, we demonstrate a generalization of the Helmholtz free energy for the finite-time stochastic evolution of driven Newtonian matter. By analyzing this expression term by term, we are able to argue for a general tendency in driven many-particle systems towards self-organization into states formed through exceptionally reliable absorption and dissipation of work energy from the surrounding environment. Subsequently, we illustrate the mechanism of this general tendency towards physical adaptation by analyzing the process of random hopping in driven energy landscapes.},

abstract = {Emulsions consisting of droplets immersed in a fluid are typically unstable since they coarsen over time. One important coarsening process is Ostwald ripening, which is driven by the surface tension of the droplets. Stability of emulsions is relevant not only in complex fluids but also in biological cells, which contain liquidlike compartments, e.g., germ granules, Cajal bodies, and centrosomes. Such cellular systems are driven away from equilibrium, e.g., by chemical reactions, and thus can be called active emulsions. In this paper, we study such active emulsions by developing a coarse-grained description of the droplet dynamics, which we analyze for two different chemical reaction schemes. We first consider the simple case of first-order reactions, which leads to stable, monodisperse emulsions in which Ostwald ripening is suppressed within a range of chemical reaction rates. We then consider autocatalytic droplets, which catalyze the production of their own droplet material. Spontaneous nucleation of autocatalytic droplets is strongly suppressed and their emulsions are typically unstable. We show that autocatalytic droplets can be nucleated reliably and their emulsions stabilized by the help of chemically active cores, which catalyze the production of droplet material. In summary, different reaction schemes and catalytic cores can be used to stabilize emulsions and to control their properties.},

Despite the difficulties, these problems can be analyzed in terms of how model-building observers infer from measurements the computational capabilities embedded in nonlinear processes. An observers notion of what is ordered, what is random, and what is complex in its environment depends directly on its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and inference. The discovery of structure in an environment depends more critically and subtlely, though, on how those resources are organized. The descriptive power of the observers chosen (or implicit) computational model class, for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding regularity in data.},

abstract = {Purpose: Following Holland, complex adaptive systems (CASs) are collections of interacting, autonomous, learning decision makers embedded in an interactive environment. Modeling CASs is challenging for a variety of reasons including the presence of heterogeneity, spatial relationships, nonlinearity, and, of course, adaptation. The challenges of modeling CASs can largely be overcome by using the individual-level focus of agent-based modeling. Agent-based modeling has been used successfully to model CASs in many disciplines. Many of these models were implemented using agent-based modeling software such as Swarm, Repast 3, Repast Simphony, Repast for High-Performance Computing, MASON, NetLogo, or StarLogo. All of these options use modular imperative architectures with factored agents, spaces, a scheduler, logs, and an interface. Many custom agent-based models also use this kind of architecture. This paper's contribution is to introduce and apply a theoretical formalism for analyzing modular imperative agent-based models of CASs. This paper includes an analysis of three example models to show how the formalism is useful for predicting the execution time and space requirements for representations of common CASs. Method: The paper details the formalism and then uses it to prove several new findings about modular imperative agent-based models. Results: It is proven that the asymptotic time and space performance of modular imperative agent-based modeling studies is computationally optimal for a common class of problems. Here ‘optimal' means that no other technique can solve the same problem computationally using less asymptotic time or space. Modular imperative agent-based models are shown to be universal models, subject to the correctness of the Church-Turing thesis. Several other results are also proven about the time and space performance of modular imperative agent-based models. The formalism is then used to predict the performance of three models and the results are found to compare closely to the measured performance. Conclusions: This paper's contribution is to introduce, analyze, and apply a theoretical formalism for proving findings about agent-based models with modular agent scheduler architectures. Given that this kind of modeling is both computationally optimal and a natural structural match for many modeling problems, it follows that it is the best modeling method for such problems.},

The vast amount of data generated so far, however, remains largely unused in environmental prediction. In this paper, we use VHF data of the Florida coastline to locate Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) hidden in ocean surface currents. Such structures govern the spread of organic contaminants and passive drifters that stay confined to the ocean surface. We use the Lagrangian structures in a real-time pollution release scheme that reduces the effect of industrial contamination on the coastal environment. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Shockley1957,
abstract = {It is well-known that some workers in scientific research laboratories are enormously more creative than others. If the number of scientific publications is used as a measure of productivity, it is found that some individuals create new science at a rate at least fifty times greater than others. Thus differences in rates of scientific production are much bigger than differences in the rates of performing simpler acts, such as the rate of running the mile, or the number of words a man can speak per minute. On the basis of statistical studies of rates of publication, it is found that it is more appropriate to consider not simply the rate of publication but its logarithm. The logarithm appears to have a normal distribution over the population of typical research laboratories. The existence of a "log-normal distribution" suggests that the logarithm of the rate of production is a manifestation of some fairly fundamental mental attribute. The great variation in rate of production from one individual to another can be explained on the basis of simplified models of the mental processes concerned. The common feature in the models is that a large number of factors are involved so that small changes in each, all in the same direction, may result in a very large change in output. For example, the number of ideas a scientist can bring into awareness at one time may control his ability to make an invention and his rate of invention may increase very rapidly with this number.},

@article{Harte2009,
abstract = {Classic theory predicts species richness scales as the quarter-power of area, yet species–area relationships (SAR) vary widely depending on habitat, taxa, and scale range. Because power-law SAR are used to predict species loss under habitat loss, and to scale species richness from plots to biomes, insight into the wide variety of observed SAR and the conditions under which power-law behavior should be observed is needed. Here we derive from the maximum entropy principle, a new procedure for upscaling species richness data from small census plots to larger areas, and test empirically, using multiple data sets, the prediction that up to an overall scale displacement, nested SAR lie along a universal curve, with average abundance per species at each scale determining the local slope of the curve. Power-law behaviour only arises in the limit of increasing average abundance, and in that limit, the slope approaches zero, not ¼. An extrapolation of tree species richness in the Western Ghats to biome scale (60 000 km2) using only census data at plot scale (¼ ha) is presented to illustrate the potential for applications of our theory.

abstract = {When some external agency imposes on a fluid large-scale variations of some dynamically passive, conserved, scalar quantity $\theta$ like temperature or concentration of solute, turbulent motion of the fluid generates small-scale variations of $\theta$. This paper describes a theoretical investigation of the form of the spectrum of $\theta$ at large wave-numbers, taking into account the two effects of convection with the fluid and molecular diffusion with diffusivity k. Hypotheses of the kind made by Kolmogoroff for the small-scale variations of velocity in a turbulent motion at high Reynolds number are assumed to apply also to small-scale variations of $\theta$. Previous contributions to the problem are reviewed. These have established that the spectrum of $\theta$ varies as  n{\^{}}{\{}- $\backslash$frac {\{}5{\}} {\{}3{\}}{\}} (n being wave-number) at the low wave-number end of the equilibrium range, but there has been some confusion about the wave-number marking the upper end of the range of validity of this relation. The existence of a conduction {\{}$\backslash$lq{\}}cut-$\backslash$noff{\{}$\backslash$rq{\}} near  n = $\backslash$isin{\{}$\backslash$sol{\}}k {\{}{\^{}}3{\}}) {\{}{\^{}}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}} as put forward by Obukhoff and Corrsin is shown to hold only when $\nu$ [double less-than sign] $\kappa$, and that near n = ($\epsilon$/$\nu$$\kappa$2)  {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}} put forward by Batchelor is shown to apply only when $\nu$ [dbl greater-than sign] $\kappa$. In the case $\nu$ [double less-than sign] $\kappa$, the remaining problem is to determine the form of the spectrum of $\theta$ beyond the conduction cut-off; this is done in Part 2. In the case $\nu$ [dbl greater-than sign] $\kappa$, the conduction cut-off occurs at wave-numbers much higher than ($\epsilon$/$\nu$3) {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}}, which is where the energy spectrum is cut off by viscosity, and where the spectrum of $\theta$ ceases to vary as  n{\^{}}{\{}- $\backslash$frac {\{}5{\}} {\{}3{\}}{\}}. The form of the spectrum of $\theta$ in this latter case is determined over the range n {\textgreater} ($\epsilon$/$\nu$3) {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}} by analysing the effect of the velocity field, regarded as effectively a persistent uniform straining motion for these small-scale variations of $\theta$, and of molecular diffusion on a single Fourier component of $\theta$.$\backslash$nThe wave-number of this sinusoidal variation of $\theta$ is changed (and generally increased in magnitude) by the straining motion and the amplitude is diminished by diffusion. By supposing that the level of the spectrum of $\theta$ is kept steady at wave-numbers near ($\epsilon$/$\nu$3) {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}} by some mechanism of transfer from lower wave-numbers, the linearity of the equation for $\theta$ then allows the determination of the spectrum for n {\textgreater} ($\epsilon$/$\nu$3)  {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}}, the result being given by (4.8). The same result is obtained, using essentially the same approximation about the velocity field, from a different kind of analysis in terms of velocity and $\theta$ correlations. Finally, the relation between this work and Townsend's model of the small-scale variations of vorticity in a turbulent fluid is discussed.},

This new measure, referred to as the Mix-Norm, resolves the inability of the L2 variance of the scalar density field to capture small-scale variations when advected by chaotic maps or flows. In addition, the Mix-Norm succeeds in capturing the efficiency of a mixing protocol in the context of a particular initial scalar field, wherein Lyapunov-exponent based measures fail to do so. We relate the Mix-Norm to the classical ergodic theoretic notion of mixing and present its formulation in terms of the power spectrum of the scalar field. We demonstrate the utility of the Mix-Norm by showing how it measures the efficiency of mixing due to various discrete dynamical systems and to diffusion. In particular, we show that the Mix-Norm can capture known exponential and algebraic mixing properties of certain maps. We also analyze numerically the behaviour of scalar fields evolved by the Standard Map using the Mix-Norm. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We study the Lagrangian dynamics of systems of N point vortices and passive particles in a two-dimensional, doubly periodic domain. The probability distribution function of vortex velocity, p{\_}N, has a slow-velocity Gaussian component and a significant high-velocity tail caused by close vortex pairs. In the limit for N -{\textgreater} oo, p{\_}N tends to a Gaussian. However, the form of the single-vortex velocity causes very slow convergence with N; for N {\~{}} 10{\^{}}6 the non-Gaussian high-velocity tails still play a significant role. At finite N, the Gaussian component is well modeled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process with variance sigma{\_}N = sqrt{\{}N ln N /2 pi{\}}. Considering in detail the case N=100, we show that at short times the velocity autocorrelation is dominated by the Gaussian component and displays an exponential decay with a short Lagrangian decorrelation time. The close pairs have a long correlation time and cause nonergodicity over at least the time of the integration. Due to close vortex dipoles the absolute dispersion differs significantly from the OU prediction, and shows evidence of long-time anomalous dispersion. We discuss the mathematical form of a new stochastic model for the Lagrangian dynamics, consisting of an OU model combined with long-lived close same-sign vortices engaged in rapid rotation and long-lived close dipoles engaged in ballistic motion. From a dynamical-systems perspective this work indicates that systems of dimension O(100) can have behavior which is a combination of both low-dimensional behavior, i.e. close pairs, and extremely high-dimensional behavior described by traditional stochastic processes.},

@article{Evans2002,
abstract = {The question of how reversible microscopic equations of motion can lead to irreversible macroscopic behaviour has been one of the central issues in statistical mechanics for more than a century. The basic issues were known to Gibbs. Boltzmann conducted a very public debate with Loschmidt and others without a satisfactory resolution. In recent decades there has been no real change in the situation. In 1993 we discovered a relation, subsequently known as the Fluctuation Theorem (FT), which gives an analytical expression for the probability of observing Second Law violating dynamical fluctuations in thermostatted dissipative non-equilibrium systems. The relation was derived heuristically and applied to the special case of dissipative non-equilibrium systems subject to constant energy 'thermostatting'. These restrictions meant that the full importance of the Theorem was not immediately apparent. Within a few years, derivations of the Theorem were improved but it has only been in the last few of years that the generality of the Theorem has been appreciated. We now know that the Second Law of Thermodynamics can be derived assuming ergodicity at equilibrium, and causality. We take the assumption of causality to be axiomatic. It is causality which ultimately is responsible for breaking time reversal symmetry and which leads to the possibility of irreversible macroscopic behaviour. The Fluctuation Theorem does much more than merely prove that in large systems observed for long periods of time, the Second Law is overwhelmingly likely to be valid. The Fluctuation Theorem quantifies the probability of observing Second Law violations in small systems observed for a short time. Unlike the Boltzmann equation, the FT is completely consistent with Loschmidt's observation that for time reversible dynamics, every dynamical phase space trajectory and its conjugate time reversed 'anti-trajectory', are both solutions of the underlying equations of motion. Indeed the standard proofs of the FT explicitly consider conjugate pairs of phase space trajectories. Quantitative predictions made by the Fluctuation Theorem regarding the probability of Second Law violations have been confirmed experimentally, both using molecular dynamics computer simulation and very recently in laboratory experiments.},

abstract = {Values of rate of decay and mean life of atoms and molecules in upper quantum states calculated from data on the intensity of absorption lines.-By combining F{\"{u}}chtbauer's method of determining from the intensity of absorption lines the probability that a molecule will absorb a quantum of energy, with Einstein's views as to the mechanism of light absorption and emission, the following equation is derived for calculating the rate at which molecules jump from upper to lower quantum states: A21=8$\pi$$\nu$2c2N1p1p2$\alpha$d$\nu$ where A21 is the chance per unit time that a molecule will jump spontaneously from quantum state 2 to quantum state 1, $\nu$ is the frequency of the light emitted in such a jump, p1 and p2 are the a priori probabilities of quantum states 1 and 2, and $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient of the substance measured under conditions such that N1 is the number of molecules per unit volume in the lower quantum state 1. The integral ;$\alpha$d$\nu$ is to be taken over the total effective width of the absorption line corresponding to the passage of molecules from quantum state 1 to quantum state 2. The mean life $\tau$ of molecules which decay from state 2 to state 1 is the reciprocal of A21. Values of A21 and $\tau$ are calculated from existing data for the mercury line $\lambda$2537, for a number of lines belonging to the alkali doublets, for the iodine line $\lambda$5461, and for a very considerable number of lines belonging to the rotation-oscillation spectra of the hydrogen halides. The values obtained agree with the meager data made available by other experimental methods. From these results the following conclusions are drawn. The mean life of molecules and atoms in upper quantum states may vary for different states at least over the range 1 to 10-8 seconds. The rate of decay is not a simple function of the frequency of the emitted light. The rate corresponding to the emission of a line of high frequency may be greater or less than that for a line of lower frequency. The data now available for the alkali doublets 1s-mp1 and 1s-mp2 indicate a higher rate of decay the smaller the change in total quantum number for the line under consideration. The rate of decay from a given mp1 state is m times as great as from the corresponding mp2 state (already stated in another form by F{\"{u}}chtbauer and Hofmann). In the case of the rotation-oscillation spectra of the hydrogen halides the rate of decay is greater for quantum states with one unit of oscillation and many of rotation, than for those with one unit of oscillation and only a few of rotation; and in the case of different molecules but the same quantum numbers the rate of decay is greater for the molecule with the greater frequency of oscillation. Finally the possibility and method of calculating absolute values of A21 from the Bohr correspondence principle is indicated. {\textcopyright} 1924 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Acoustically sensitive emulsions are a promising tool for medical applications such as localized drug delivery. The physical mechanisms underlying the ultrasound-triggered nucleation and subsequent vaporization of these phase-change emulsions are largely unexplored. Here, the acoustic vaporization of individual micron-sized perfluoropentane (PFP) droplets is studied at a nanoseconds timescale. Highly diluted emulsions of PFP-in-water and oil-in-PFP-in-water droplets, ranging from 3.5 to 11 $\mu$m in radius, were prepared and the nucleation and growth of the vapor bubbles was imaged at frame rates of up to 20 Mfps. The droplet vaporization dynamics was observed to have three distinct regimes: (1) prior to nucleation, a regime of droplet deformation and oscillatory translations within the surrounding fluid along the propagation direction of the applied ultrasound; (2) a regime characterized by the rapid growth of a vapor bubble enhanced by ultrasound-driven rectified heat transfer; and (3) a final phase characterized by a relatively slow expansion, after ultrasound stops, that is fully dominated by heat transfer. A method to measure the moment of inception of the nucleation event with respect to the phase of the ultrasound wave is proposed. A simple physical model captures quantitatively all of the features of the subsequent vapor bubble growth.},

abstract = {Verification and validation (V{\&}V) are the primary means to assess accuracy and reliability in computational simulations. This paper presents an extensive review of the literature in V{\&}V in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), discusses methods and procedures for assessing V{\&}V, and develops a number of extensions to existing ideas. The review of the development of V{\&}V terminology and methodology points out the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics, and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V{\&}V are addressed, such as code verification versus solution verification, model validation versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty, conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of verification is the identification and quantification of errors in the computational model and its solution. In verification activities, the accuracy of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software testing during verification activities is emphasized. The fundamental strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational results compare with the experimental data, with quantified error and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical methodology that segregates and simplifies the physical and coupling phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest. A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments, supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods. Consistent with the authors' contention that nondeterministic simulations are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed. In the spirit of advancing the state of the art in V{\&}V, the paper concludes with recommendations of topics for future research and with suggestions for needed changes in the implementation of V{\&}V in production and commercial software.},

abstract = {Complex systems such as glasses, gels, granular materials, and systems far from equilibrium exhibit violation of the ergodic hypothesis (EH) and of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). Recent investigations in systems with memory have established a hierarchical connection between mixing, the EH and the FDT. They have shown that a failure of the mixing condition (MC) will lead to the subsequent failures of the EH and of the FDT. Another important point is that such violations are not limited to complex systems: simple systems may also display this feature. Results from such systems are analytical and obviously easier to understand than those obtained in complex structures, where a large number of competing phenomena are present. In this work, we review some important requirements for the validity of the FDT and its connection with mixing, the EH and anomalous diffusion in one-dimensional systems. We show that when the FDT fails, an out-of-equilibrium system relaxes to an effective temperature different from that of the heat reservoir. This effective temperature is a signature of metastability found in many complex systems such as spin-glasses and granular materials.},

At high ratios of activity to elasticity, the linear instability develops into nonlinear fluctuating states with large amplitude deformations. The dynamics of these states can be qualitatively understood as a superposition of translational and rotational motion associated with filament conformational modes of opposite symmetry.

abstract = {Large scale chemical reaction networks are a ubiquitous phenomenon, from the metabolism of living cells to processes in planetary atmospheres and chemical technology. At least some of these networks exhibit distinctive global features such as the "small world" behavior. The systematic study of such properties, however, suffers from substantial sampling biases in the few networks that are known in detail. A computational model for generating them is therefore required. Here we present a Toy Model that provides a consistent framework in which generic properties of extensive chemical reaction networks can be explored in detail and that at the same time preserves the "look-and-feel" of chemistry: Molecules are represented as labeled graphs, i.e., by their structural formulas; their basic properties are derived by a caricature version of the Extended H{\"{u}}ckel MO theory that operates directly on the graphs; chemical reaction mechanisms are implemented as graph rewriting rules acting on the structural formulas; reactivities and selectivities are modeled by a variant of the Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory based on the Extended H{\"{u}}ckel scheme. The approach is illustrated for two types of reaction networks: Diels-Alder reactions and the formose reaction implicated in prebiotic sugar synthesis.},

@article{JONES1994,
abstract = {The dispersion of passive scalars by the steady viscous flow through a twisted pipe is both a simple example of chaotic advection and an elaboration of Taylor's classic shear dispersion problem. In this article we study the statistics of the axial dispersion of both diffusive and perfect (non- diffusive) tracer in this system. For diffusive tracer chaotic advection assists molecular diffusion in transverse mixing and so diminishes the axial dispersion below that of integrable advection. As in many other studies of shear dispersion the axial distribution ultimately becomes Gaussian as t --{\textgreater} infinity. Thus there is a diffusive regime, but with an effective diffusivity that is enhanced above molecular values. In contrast to the classic case, the effective diffusivity is not necessarily inversely proportional to the molecular diffusivity. For instance, in the irregular regime the effective diffusivity is proportional to the logarithm of the molecular diffusivity. For perfect tracer chaotic advection does not result in a diffusive process, even in the irregular regime in which streamlines wander throughout the cross-section of the pipe. Instead the variance of the axial position is proportional to t ln t so that the measured diffusion coefficient diverges like ln t. This faster than linear growth of variance is attributed to the trapping of tracer for long times near the solid boundary, where the no-slip condition ensures that the fluid moves slowly. Analogous logarithmic effects associated with the no-slip condition are well known in the context of porous media. A simple argument, based on Lagrangian statistics and a local analysis of the trajectories near the pipe wall, is used to calculate the constants of proportionality before the logarithmic terms in both the large- and infinite-Peclet-number limits.},

abstract = {Genetic Algorithms (GA) are a powerful set of tools for search and optimization that mimic the process of natural selection, and have been used successfully in a wide variety of problems, including evolving neural networks to solve cognitive tasks. Despite their success, GAs sometimes fail to locate the highest peaks of the fitness landscape, in particular if the landscape is rugged and contains multiple peaks. Reaching distant and higher peaks is difficult because valleys need to be crossed, in a process that (at least temporarily) runs against the fitness maximization objective. Here we propose and test a number of information-theoretic (as well as network-based) measures that can be used in conjunction with a fitness maximization objective (so-called ``neuro-correlates") to evolve neural controllers for two widely different tasks: a behavioral task that requires information integration, and a cognitive task that requires memory and logic. We find that judiciously chosen neuro-correlates can significantly aid GAs to find the highest peaks.},

In this paper, we develop a Boltzmann machine that is capable of modelling thermodynamic observables for physical systems in thermal equilibrium. Through unsupervised learning, we train the Boltzmann machine on data sets constructed with spin configurations importance-sampled from the partition function of an Ising Hamiltonian at different temperatures using Monte Carlo (MC) methods. The trained Boltzmann machine is then used to generate spin states, for which we compare thermodynamic observables to those computed by direct MC sampling. We demonstrate that the Boltzmann machine can faithfully reproduce the observables of the physical system. Further, we observe that the number of neurons required to obtain accurate results increases as the system is brought close to criticality.},

The design procedure is detailed and the numerical solver has been verified against analytical solutions for simple cases and also applied to various field calculation problems. In particular, the simulator is demonstrated for inverse RF coil design, optimized source profile generation, and parallel imaging in high-frequency situations.

abstract = {Acoustically sensitive emulsion droplets composed of a liquid perfluorocarbon have the potential to be a highly efficient system for local drug delivery, embolotherapy, or for tumor imaging. The physical mechanisms underlying the acoustic activation of these phase-change emulsions into a bubbly dispersion, termed acoustic droplet vaporization, have not been well understood. The droplets have a very high activation threshold; its frequency dependence does not comply with homogeneous nucleation theory and localized nucleation spots have been observed. Here we show that acoustic droplet vaporization is initiated by a combination of two phenomena: highly nonlinear distortion of the acoustic wave before it hits the droplet and focusing of the distorted wave by the droplet itself. At high excitation pressures, nonlinear distortion causes significant superharmonics with wavelengths of the order of the droplet size. These superharmonics strongly contribute to the focusing effect; therefore, the proposed mechanism also explains the observed pressure thresholding effect. Our interpretation is validated with experimental data captured with an ultrahigh-speed camera on the positions of the nucleation spots, where we find excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction. Moreover, the presented mechanism explains the hitherto counterintuitive dependence of the nucleation threshold on the ultrasound frequency. The physical insight allows for the optimization of acoustic droplet vaporization for therapeutic applications, in particular with respect to the acoustic pressures required for activation, thereby minimizing the negative bioeffects associated with the use of high-intensity ultrasound.},

Yet, many researches have suggested that the principle of the maximum entropy production is of key importance in complex systems away from equilibrium. Here, we present a quantitative study of large ensembles of carbon nanotubes suspended in a non-conducting non-polar fluid subject to a strong electric field. Being driven out of equilibrium, the suspension spontaneously organizes into an electrically conducting state under a wide range of parameters. Such self-assembly allows the Joule heating and, therefore, the entropy production in the fluid, to be maximized. Curiously, we find that emerging self-assembled structures can start to wiggle. The wiggling takes place only until the entropy production in the suspension reaches its maximum, at which time the wiggling stops and the structure becomes quasi-stable. Thus, we provide strong evidence that maximum entropy production principle plays an essential role in the evolution of self-organizing systems far from equilibrium.},

abstract = {Fluctuation theorems, developed over the past 15 years, have resulted in fundamental breakthroughs in our understanding of how irre-versibility emerges from reversible dynamics and have provided new statistical mechanical relationships for free-energy changes. They describe the statistical fluctuations in time-averaged properties of many-particle systems such as fluids driven to nonequilibrium states and provide some of the few analytical expressions that describe nonequilibrium states. Quantitative predictions on fluctuations in small systems that are monitored over short periods can also be made, and therefore the fluctuation theorems allow thermodynamic con-cepts to be extended to apply to finite systems. For this reason, we anticipate an important role for fluctuation theorems in the design of nanotechnological devices and in the understanding of biologi-cal processes. This review discusses these theorems, their physical significance, and results for experimental and model systems. Macroscopic irreversibility: macroscopic processes have a direction associated with them; the opposing direction is prohibited by the second law},

These schemes are widely used, simulating, e.g., neutral and plasma flows. FD schemes have long been considered fast, relatively easy to implement, and applicable to complex geometries, but are somewhat inferior in accuracy compared to spectral schemes. Using two study cases at high Reynolds number, the merging of two equally signed Gaussian vortices in a periodic box and dipole interaction with a no-slip wall, we will demonstrate that the accuracy of FD schemes can be significantly improved if one is careful in choosing an appropriate FD scheme that reflects conservation properties of the nonlinear terms and in setting up the grid in accordance with the problem.},

A typical example is a conformational change in myosin II responsible for the power-stroke in skeletal muscles. In this paper we present an athermal perspective on such folding by analyzing the simplest purely mechanical prototype: a parallel bundle of bi-stable units attached to a common backbone. We show that in this analytically transparent model, characterized by a rugged energy landscape, the ground states are always highly coherent, single-phase configurations. We argue that such cooperative behavior, ensuring collective conformational change, is due to the dominance of long- range interactions making the system non-additive. The detailed predictions of our model are in agreement with experimentally observed non-equivalence of fast force recovery in skeletal muscles loaded in soft and hard devices. Some features displayed by the model are also recognizable in the behavior of other biological systems with passive multi-stability and long-range interactions including detaching adhesive binders and pulled RNA/DNA hairpins.},

abstract = {Structures generated by magma mixing in a lava flow are studied with the aim to understand the interplay between chemical diffusion and the dynamics of the mixing process. Mesoscopic analysis of mixing structures indicates that magmas mixed intimately generating the contemporaneous occurrence of filament-like and globular regions within the same system. The extent of chemical exchange between interacting magmas has been measured by EPMA and LAM-ICP-MS analysis on a transect crossing filaments. Results indicate that elements with similar values of diffusion coefficients display linear correlations in interelemental plots whereas elements with different diffusion coefficients do not show any correlation. The mixing process has been simulated by coupling a chaotic advection and a chemical diffusion numerical scheme for several elements. Simulations show that the occurrence of chaotic flow fields is essential to explain the decoupling of the correlation at a short length scale between elements with similar and different diffusion coefficients, as observed in natural samples. In particular, the "sensitivity to initial conditions" of chaotic systems induces elements having similar values of diffusion coefficients to be linearly correlated in interelemental plots, whereas, at the same time, the correlation between elements having different diffusion coefficients is lost. The degree of correlation of the different elements in the simulations and natural data has been utilized to estimate the intensity of mixing, and results indicate intermediate mixing intensities for the natural samples, according to field evidence. It is shown that chemical diffusion processes coupled with chaotic mixing dynamics can generate strongly dishomogeneous batches of magmas coexisting at a very short length scale (of the order of a few microns) in which elements display very different degrees of correlation depending on the magnitude of their diffusion coefficients. These results open a key question about the suitability of using melt inclusions for petrogenetic purposes in magma mixing systems because they may be affected by the small-scale dishomogeneity of the magmatic system. On the contrary, it is shown that whole rock analysis is a more suitable technique to understand rock petrogenesis because it is poorly influenced by this dishomogeneity. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, transfer entropy, characterizing the function of computational transmission and its predictability, is known to peak near critical regimes. We focus on a thermodynamic interpretation of transfer entropy aiming to explain the underlying critical behavior by associating information flows intrinsic to computational transmission with particular physical fluxes. Specifically, in isothermal systems near thermodynamic equilibrium, the gradient of the average transfer entropy is shown to be dynamically related to Fisher information and the curvature of system's entropy. This relationship explicitly connects the predictability, sensitivity, and uncertainty of computational processes intrinsic to complex systems and allows us to consider thermodynamic interpretations of several important extreme cases and trade-offs. {\textcopyright} 2015 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The emergence of coherent structures, large-scale flows and correlated dynamics in suspensions of motile particles such as swimming micro-organisms or artificial microswimmers is studied using direct particle simulations. A detailed model is proposed for a slender rod-like particle that propels itself in a viscous fluid by exerting a prescribed tangential stress on its surface, and a method is devised for the efficient calculation of hydrodynamic interactions in large-scale suspensions of such particles using slender-body theory and a smooth particle-mesh Ewald algorithm. Simulations are performed with periodic boundary conditions for various system sizes and suspension volume fractions, and demonstrate a transition to large-scale correlated motions in suspensions of rear-actuated swimmers, or Pushers, above a critical volume fraction or system size. This transition, which is not observed in suspensions of head-actuated swimmers, or Pullers, is seen most clearly in particle velocity and passive tracer statistics. These observations are consistent with predictions from our previous mean-field kinetic theory, one of which states that instabilities will arise in uniform isotropic suspensions of Pushers when the product of the linear system size with the suspension volume fraction exceeds a given threshold. We also find that the collective dynamics of Pushers result in giant number fluctuations, local alignment of swimmers and strongly mixing flows. Suspensions of Pullers, which evince no large-scale dynamics, nonetheless display interesting deviations from the random isotropic state.},

abstract = {Self-replication is a capacity common to every species of living thing, and simple physical intuition dictates that such a process must invariably be fueled by the production of entropy. Here, we undertake to make this intuition rigorous and quantitative by deriving a lower bound for the amount of heat that is produced during a process of self-replication in a system coupled to a thermal bath. We find that the minimum value for the physically allowed rate of heat production is determined by the growth rate, internal entropy, and durability of the replicator, and we discuss the implications of this finding for bacterial cell division, as well as for the pre-biotic emergence of self-replicating nucleic acids.},

abstract = {Approximate resolution of linear systems of differential equations with varying coefficients is a recurrent problem, shared by a number of scientific and engineering areas, ranging from Quantum Mechanics to Control Theory. When formulated in operator or matrix form, the Magnus expansion furnishes an elegant setting to build up approximate exponential representations of the solution of the system. It provides a power series expansion for the corresponding exponent and is sometimes referred to as Time-Dependent Exponential Perturbation Theory. Every Magnus approximant corresponds in Perturbation Theory to a partial re-summation of infinite terms with the important additional property of preserving, at any order, certain symmetries of the exact solution. The goal of this review is threefold. First, to collect a number of developments scattered through half a century of scientific literature on Magnus expansion. They concern the methods for the generation of terms in the expansion, estimates of the radius of convergence of the series, generalizations and related non-perturbative expansions. Second, to provide a bridge with its implementation as generator of especial purpose numerical integration methods, a field of intense activity during the last decade. Third, to illustrate with examples the kind of results one can expect from Magnus expansion, in comparison with those from both perturbative schemes and standard numerical integrators. We buttress this issue with a revision of the wide range of physical applications found by Magnus expansion in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A pressure driven 2D channel flow at very low Reynolds numbers (Stokes flow) with a bubble sticking and sliding along one of the walls is studied computationally using the boundary element method (BEM). The moving three phase contact lines are modeled using a Tanner law wherein the contact line speed is linearly proportional to the deviation of the contact angle from its equilibrium value. Results are presented with and without the effect of contact angle hysteresis. Including contact angle hysteresis allows us to predict the stick-slide behavior of bubbles, which in turn affects the long term evolution and dynamics of the bubbles. It is shown that the initial rapid contraction or expansion of the bubbles to achieve local equilibrium with the surrounding pressure field results in cusps and bulges in the wall normal stress profiles. The wall shear stress also increases (with opposite signs upstream and downstream of the bubble) as the fluid rushes in or out of the channel inlet and outlet. In the long term, bubbles slowly expand as they slide along the channel wall. Contact lines are found to correspond to peaks in the wall normal and shear stress profiles at all times. The effectiveness of bubbles in occluding flow through the channel is also examined. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Quantum phenomena of interest in connection with applications to computation and communication often involve generating specific transfers between eigenstates, and their linear superpositions. For some quantum systems, such as spin systems, the quantum evolution equation (the Schro{\&}{\#}x0308;dinger equation) is finite-dimensional and old results on controllability of systems defined on on Lie groups and quotient spaces provide most of what is needed insofar as controllability of non-dissipative systems is concerned. However, in an infinite-dimensional setting, controlling the evolution of quantum systems often presents difficulties, both conceptual and technical. In this paper we present a systematic approach to a class of such problems for which it is possible to avoid some of the technical issues. In particular, we analyze controllability for infinite-dimensional bilinear systems under assumptions that make controllability possible using trajectories lying in a nested family of pre-defined subspaces. This result, which we call the Finite Controllability Theorem, provides a set of sufficient conditions for controllability in an infinite-dimensional setting. We consider specific physical systems that are of interest for quantum computing, and provide insights into the types of quantum operations (gates) that may be developed.},

@article{Osserman1978,
abstract = {The problem, which closed plane curve of given length encloses the largest area, was already known in antiquity, with its solution the circle. According to legend, the Phoenician princess Dido founded the city of Carthago on a piece of land obtained from the local king. As she got only as much land as could be encompassed by an oxhide, she let the hide be cut into thin strips, so that she had enough to encircle an entire hill nearby. A satisfactory proof that the solution is a circle was rst obtained in the 19th century. The famous geometer Jacob Steiner give a proof, based on geometric constructions, which starting from a curve, dierent from a circle, leads to a curve with the same length, but enclosing a strictly larger area. Dirichlet, his colleague in Berlin, tried without success to convince him that this does not suce as proof, without showing the existence of a solution. Many proofs are now known. The one below goes back to Hurwitz. The analytic part can be isolated in the following lemma. Wirtinger's inequality. Let f (t) be a piecewise smooth, continuous 2$\pi$-periodic function with mean value 0, i.e., 2$\pi$ 0 f (t)dt = 0. Then 2$\pi$ 0 (f) 2 dt ≥ 2$\pi$ 0 f 2 dt , with equality if and only if f (t) = a cos t + b sin t, where a and b are constants. The condition for equality can also be stated as f (t) = a cos(t + b), where a and b are (new) constants; this follows from the addition formulas for sine and cosine. Using Wirtinger's inequality we can give a simple proof of the isoperimetric inequality. Theorem. Let $\gamma$ be a simple closed curve with length l, enclosing an area A. Then l 2 ≥ 4$\pi$A with equality if and only if $\gamma$ is a circle. Proof. We parametrise $\gamma$ with constant speed l/2$\pi$. By a translation we may assume that 2$\pi$ 0 x(t)dt = 0. Now l 2 /2$\pi$ = 2$\pi$ 0 (t) 2 dt = 2$\pi$ 0 (x) 2 + (y) 2 dt. We compute the area with Green's theorem to be A = int($\gamma$) dxdy = 2$\pi$ 0 xy dt. This gives us l 2 − 4$\pi$A = 2$\pi$ 2$\pi$ 0 (x) 2 + (y) 2 − 2xy dt = 2$\pi$ 2$\pi$ 0 (x) 2 − x 2 dt + 2$\pi$ 2$\pi$ 0 (y − x) 2 dt ≥ 0 , 1 where the rst integral is non-negative by Wirtinger's inequality for the function x(t), and the integrand of the second is non-negative. Equality holds if and only if x(t) = a cos(t + b) and y = x, so y(t) = a sin(t + b) + c. Because},

Here we show that zero-determinant strategies are at most weakly dominant, are not evolutionarily stable, and will instead evolve into less coercive strategies. We show that zero-determinant strategies with an informational advantage over other players that allows them to recognize each other can be evolutionarily stable (and able to exploit other players). However, such an advantage is bound to be short-lived as opposing strategies evolve to counteract the recognition.},

We show how the network is described as a discrete Markov process and how the detailed balance condition and the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution are sufficient conditions for a complete thermodynamics description, including nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems. Numerical simulations in a fully trained RBM are performed and the heat exchange fluctuation theorem is verified with excellent agreement to the theory. We observe how the contrastive divergence functional, mostly used in unsupervised learning of RBMs, is closely related to nonequilibrium thermodynamic quantities. We also use the framework to interpret the estimation of the partition function of RBMs with the Annealed Importance Sampling method from a thermodynamics standpoint. Finally, we argue that unsupervised learning of RBMs is equivalent to a work protocol in a system driven by the laws of thermodynamics in the absence of labeled data.},

abstract = {The choice that bacteria make between sporulation and competence when subjected to stress provides a prototypical example of collective cell fate determination that is stochastic on the individual cell level, yet predictable (deterministic) on the population level. This collective decision is performed by an elaborated gene network. Considerable effort has been devoted to simplify its complexity by taking physics approaches to untangle the basic functional modules that are integrated to form the complete network: (1) A stochastic switch whose transition probability is controlled by two order parameters-population density and internal/external stress. (2) An adaptable timer whose clock rate is normalized by the same two previous order parameters. (3) Sensing units which measure population density and external stress. (4) A communication module that exchanges information about the cells' internal stress levels. (5) An oscillating gate of the stochastic switch which is regulated by the timer. The unique circuit architecture of the gate allows special dynamics and noise management features. The gate opens a window of opportunity in time for competence transitions, during which the circuit generates oscillations that are translated into a chain of short intervals with high transition probability. In addition, the unique architecture of the gate allows filtering of external noise and robustness against variations in circuit parameters and internal noise. We illustrate that a physics approach can be very valuable in investigating the decision process and in identifying its general principles. We also show that both cell-cell variability and noise have important functional roles in the collectively controlled individual decisions.},

abstract = {Non-traditional thermodynamics, applied to random behaviour associated with turbulence, mixing and competition, is reviewed and analysed. Competitive mixing represents a general framework for the study of generic properties of competitive systems and can be used to model a wide class of non-equilibrium phenomena ranging from turbulent premixed flames and invasion waves to complex competitive systems. We demonstrate consistency of the general principles of competition with thermodynamic description, review and analyse the related entropy concepts and introduce the corresponding competitive H-theorem. A competitive system can be characterised by a thermodynamic quantity - competitive potential --- which determines the likely direction of evolution of the system. Contested resources tend to move between systems from lower to higher values of the competitive potential. There is, however, an important difference between conventional thermodynamics and competitive thermodynamics. While conventional thermodynamics is constrained by its zeroth law and is fundamentally transitive, the transitivity of competitive thermodynamics depends on the transitivity of the competition rules. Intransitivities are common in the real world and are responsible for complex behaviour in competitive systems. This work follows the ideas and methods that are originated in analysis of turbulent combustion but reviews a much broader scope of issues linked to mixing and competition, including thermodynamic characterisation of complex competitive systems with self-organisation. The approach presented here is interdisciplinary and is addressed to a general educated reader, while the mathematical details can be found in the Appendices.},

Ex- amples range from aircraft and underwater vehicles to quantum mechanical systems. In this paper, we develop an algorithm for solving continuous-time optimal control problems for systems evolving on (noncompact) Lie groups. This algorithm generalizes the projection operator approach for trajectory optimization originally developed for systems on vector spaces. Notions for generalizing system theoretic tools such as Riccati equations and linear and quadratic system approximations are developed. In this development, the covariant derivative of a map between twoman- ifolds plays a key role in providing a chain rule for the required Lie group computations. An example optimal control problem on SO(3) is provided to highlight implementation details and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

Here, we study a neural network learning a linearly separable rule using examples provided by a teacher. We analyse the ability of the network to apply the rule to new inputs, that is to generalise from past experience. Using stochastic thermodynamics, we show that the thermodynamic costs of the learning process provide an upper bound on the amount of information that the network is able to learn from its teacher for both batch and online learning. This allows us to introduce a thermodynamic efficiency of learning. We analytically compute the dynamics and the efficiency of a noisy neural network performing online learning in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we analyse three popular learning algorithms, namely Hebbian, Perceptron and AdaTron learning. Our work extends the methods of stochastic thermodynamics to a new type of learning problem and might form a suitable basis for investigating the thermodynamics of decision-making.},

@article{Sidabras2005,
abstract = {This paper builds on the work of Mett and Hyde [J. Magn. Reson. 165 (2003) 137]. Various aqueous flat-cell geometries in the perpendicular orientation have been studied using Ansoft High Frequency Structure Simulator (version 9.0, Pittsburgh, PA) and Computer Simulation Technology Microwave Studio (version 5.0, Wellesley Hills, MA). The analytic theory of Mett and Hyde has been refined to predict optimum dimensions of multiple sample cell structures including the effect of the sample holder dielectric properties and the interaction of the cells with each other on EPR signal strength. From these calculations and simulations we propose a practical multiple cell sample structure for use in commercial rectangular TE 102 cavities that yields 2.0-2.3 times higher sensitivity relative to a single flat-cell in the nodal orientation. We also describe a modified TE 102 resonator design with square rather than cylindrical sample-access stacks that is predicted to give a factor of 2.2-2.7 enhancement in EPR signal strength of a single flat-cell in the nodal orientation. These signal enhancements are predicted with sample holders fabricated from polytetrafluoroethylene. Additional improvement in EPR signal of up to 75{\%} can be achieved by using sample holder materials with lower dielectric constants. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The main object of study is the enhancement of diffusive mixing by a fast incompressible flow. Due to its physical relevance, the subject has been studied in detail from different angles. Here, we describe some of the recent work which combines PDE, functional analysis and dynamical systems theory by trying to establish links between diffusion enhancement and mixing properties inherent to the dynamical system generated by the flow. The proofs are based on a general criterion for the decay of the semigroup generated by an operator of the form $\Gamma$+iAL with a negative unbounded self-adjoint operator $\Gamma$, a self-adjoint operator L, and parameter A≫1. In particular, they employ the RAGE theorem describing evolution of a quantum state belonging to the continuous spectral subspace of the Hamiltonian (related to a classical theorem of Wiener on Fourier transforms of measures).},

abstract = {This article introduces and reviews recent work using a simple optimization technique for analysing the nonlinear stability of a state in a dynamical system. The technique can be used to identify the most efficient way to disturb a system such that it transits from one stable state to another. The key idea is introduced within the framework of a finite-dimensional set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and then illustrated for a very simple system of two ODEs which possesses bistability. Then the transition to turbulence problem in fluid mechanics is used to show how the technique can be formulated for a spatially-extended system described by a set of partial differential equations (the well-known Navier–Stokes equations). Within that context, the optimization technique bridges the gap between (linear) optimal perturbation theory and the (nonlinear) dynamical systems approach to fluid flows. The fact that the technique has now been recently shown to work in this very high dimensional setting augurs well for its utility in other physical systems.},

abstract = {Using the recently derived dissipation theorem and a corollary of the transient fluctuation theorem (TFT), namely the second-law inequality, we derive the unique time independent, equilibrium phase space distribution function for an ergodic Hamiltonian system in contact with a remote heat bath. We prove under very general conditions that any deviation from this equilibrium distribution breaks the time independence of the distribution. Provided temporal correlations decay, we show that any nonequilibrium distribution that is an even function of the momenta eventually relaxes (not necessarily monotonically) to the equilibrium distribution. Finally we prove that the negative logarithm of the microscopic partition function is equal to the thermodynamic Helmholtz free energy divided by the thermodynamic temperature and Boltzmann's constant. Our results complement and extend the findings of modern ergodic theory and show the importance of dissipation in the process of relaxation towards equilibrium.},

abstract = {High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is emerging as an effective therapeutic modality in both thermal ablations for solid tumor/cancer and soft-tissue fragmentation. Mechanical and thermal effects, which play an important role in the HIFU treatment simultaneously, are dependent on the operating parameters and may vary with the progress of therapy. Mechanical erosion in the shape of a "squid," a "dumbbell" lesion with both mechanical and thermal lesions, or a "tadpole" lesion with mechanical erosion at the center and thermal necrosis on the boundary in the transparent gel phantom could be produced correspondingly with the pulse duration of 5-30 ms, which is much longer than histotripsy burst but shorter than the time for tissue boiling, and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 0.2-5 Hz. Meanwhile, variations of bubble cavitation (both inertial and stable cavitation) and temperature elevation in the focal region (i.e., z = -2.5, 0, and 2.5 mm) were measured by passive cavitation detection (PCD) and thermocouples during the therapeutic procedure, respectively. Stable cavitation increased with the pulse duration, PRF, and the number of pulses delivered. However, inertial cavitation was found to increase initially and then decrease with long pulse duration and high PRF. Temperature in the pre-focal region is always higher than those at the focal and post-focal position in all tests. Great variations of PCD signals and temperature elevation are due to the generation and persistence of large bubble, which is resistant to collapse and occurs with the increase of pulse duration and PRF. Similar lesion pattern and variations were also observed in ex vivo porcine kidneys. Hyperechoes in the B-mode ultrasound image were comparable to the shape and size of lesions in the dissected tissue. Thermal lesion volume increased with the increase of pulse duration and PRF, but mechanical erosion reached its maximum volume with the pulse duration of 20 ms and PRF of 1 Hz. Altogether, bubble cavitation and thermal field vary with the progress of HIFU treatment with different sonication parameters, which provide insights into the interaction of ultrasound burst with the induced bubbles for both soft tissue fractionation and enhancement in thermal accumulation. Appropriate synergy and monitoring of mechanical and thermal effects would broaden the HIFU application and enhance its efficiency as well as safety.},

abstract = {Scalar dissipation is of great importance in the theory and modelling of combustion and other reacting turbulent flows. Measurements of scalar dissipation are found to lack the quality assurance of checks available from the conservation equations. Conditional averages of the scalar dissipation, so important in turbulent reacting flow theory and modelling, have qualitative and quantitative dependences that are very dependent on the details of the flow and mixing conditions. Accordingly, effort needs to focus on viable means of modelling it. Fluctuations of the scalar dissipation about the conditional mean are also important. Research results in this area need to be made more accessible to the combustion scientist. Heat release effects, so important in turbulent premixed combustion, are found to be much less important in non-premixed combustion.},

@article{Crooks1999a,
abstract = {There are only a very few known relations in statistical dynamics that are valid for systems driven arbitrarily far away from equilibrium by an ex- ternal perturbation. One of these is the fluctuation theorem, which places conditions on the entropy production probability distribution of nonequilib- rium systems. Another recently discovered far-from-equilibrium expression relates nonequilibrium measurements of the work done on a system to equi- librium free energy differences. In contrast to linear response theory, these expressions are exact no matter the strength of the perturbation, or how far the system has been driven from equilibrium. In this work I show that these relations (and several other closely related results) can all be considered special cases of a single theorem. This expression is explicitly derived for discrete time and space Markovian dynamics, with the additional assump- tions that the unperturbed dynamics preserve the appropriate equilibrium ensemble, and that the energy of the system remains finite. These theoretical results indicate that the most interesting nonequi- librium phenomena will be observed during rare excursions of the system away from the stable states. However, direct simulation of the dynamics is inherently inefficient, since the majority of the computation time is taken watching small, uninteresting fluctuations about the stable states. Tran- sition path sampling has been developed as a Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample rare transitions between stable or metastable states in equilibrium systems. Here, the transition path sampling methodology is adapted to the efficient sampling of large fluctuations in nonequilibrium systems evolving according to Langevins equations of motion. Simulations are then used to study the behavior of the Maier-Stein system, an impor- tant model for a large class of nonequilibrium systems. Path sampling is also implemented for the kinetic Ising model, which is then employed to study surface induced evaporation.},

abstract = {The investigation of inertial cavitation in micro-tunnels has significant implications for the development of therapeutic applications of ultrasound such as ultrasound-mediated drug and gene delivery. The threshold for inertial cavitation was investigated using a passive cavitation detector with a center frequency of 1 MHz. Micro-tunnels of various diameters (90 to 800 ??m) embedded in gel were fabricated and injected with a solution of Optison??? contrast agent of concentrations 1.2{\%} and 0.2{\%} diluted in water. An ultrasound pulse of duration 500 ms and center frequency 1.736 MHz was used to insonate the microbubbles. The acoustic pressure was increased at 1-s intervals until broadband noise emission was detected. The pressure threshold at which broadband noise emission was observed was found to be dependent on the diameter of the micro-tunnels, with an average increase of 1.2 to 1.5 between the smallest and the largest tunnels, depending on the microbubble concentration. The evaluation of inertial cavitation in gel tunnels rather than tubes provides a novel opportunity to investigate microbubble collapse in a situation that simulates in vivo blood vessels better than tubes with solid walls do.

In a number of key cellular processes, actin filaments elongated by formins such as mDia are subject to mechanical tension, yet how mechanical forces modulate the assembly of actin filaments is an open question. Here, using the viscous drag of a microfluidic flow, we apply calibrated piconewton pulling forces to individual actin filaments that are being elongated at their barbed end by surface-anchored mDia1 proteins. We show that mDia1 is mechanosensitive and that the elongation rate of filaments is increased up to two-fold by the application of a pulling force. We also show that mDia1 is able to track a depolymerizing barbed end in spite of an opposing pulling force, which means that mDia1 can efficiently put actin filaments under mechanical tension. Our findings suggest that formin function in cells is tightly coupled to the mechanical activity of other machineries.},

As we turn our attention to smaller systems, however, statistical fluctuations become more prominent. In recent years it has become apparent that the fluctuations of systems far from thermal equilibrium are not mere background noise, but satisfy strong, useful, and unexpected properties. In particular, a proper accounting of fluctuations allows us to rewrite familiar inequalities of macroscopic thermodynamics as equalities. This review describes some of this progress, and argues that it has refined our understanding of irreversibility and the second law.},

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have yielded machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems; however, it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. In this work we introduce a basic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and cohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can manipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that state of art deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.},

If interparticle hydrodynamic interactions are neglected, the configuration of the suspension is characterized by the particle orientation distribution, which satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation including the effects of the external shear flow, rotary diffusion, and particle tumbling. The orientation distribution then determines the leading-order term in the particle extra stress in the suspension, which can be evaluated based on the classic theory of Hinch and Leal (J Fluid Mech 52(4):683-712, 1972), and involves an additional contribution arising from the permanent force dipole exerted by the particles as they propel themselves through the fluid. Numerical solutions of the steady-state Fokker-Planck equation were obtained using a spectral method, and results are reported for the shear viscosity and normal stress difference coefficients in terms of flow strength, rotary diffusivity, and correlation time for tumbling. It is found that the rheology is characterized by much stronger normal stress differences than for passive suspensions, and that tail-actuated swimmers result in a strong decrease in the effective shear viscosity of the fluid.},

The model is fully transient in both the liquid and the vapor phases. Transport properties are functions of temperature, pressure, and composition, and vary throughout the liquid droplet and the vapor boundary layer. Equilibrium at the liquid-vapor interface is calculated using the Peng-Robinson equation of state, and accounts for diffusion of the gas into the liquid droplet. The Peng-Robinson equation of state is also used to calculate the enthalpy of vaporization of the fuel species as well as the liquid and vapor mixture densities. The proposed model is compared with data obtained for a variety of liquids. The comparisons include the predictions of the critical mixing state, droplet vaporization rate, and droplet temperature. Transient effects in both the liquid and vapor phases are found to have a large effect on the droplet heatup and vaporization process. At very high temperature and pressure conditions the droplets were found to reach their thermodynamic critical mixing point in a totally transient process. Coupled diffusion processes were studied and found to be an important factor in high-pressure droplet vaporization. Anomalies in the transport properties of a fluid near its critical mixing point were studied and found to be insignificant in droplet vaporization under conditions similar to those in a diesel engine.},

abstract = {We present findings in an experiment where we obtain stationary ramified transportation networks in a macroscopic nonbiological system. Our purpose here is to introduce the phenomenology of the experiment. We describe the dynamical formation of the network which consists of three growth stages: (I) strand formation, (II) boundary formation, and (III) geometric expansion. We find that the system forms statistically robust network features, like the number of termini and the number of branch points. We also find that the networks are usually trees, meaning that they lack closed loops; indeed, we find that loops are unstable in the network. Finally, we find that the final topology of the network is sensitive to the initial conditions of the particles, in particular to its geometry.},

abstract = {The use of superheated liquid perfluorocarbon droplets encased in albumin shells has been proposed as a minimally invasive alternative to current treatment of cancer by means of occlusion therapy. In response to an applied acoustic field, these droplets, which are small enough to pass through capillaries, vaporize into large gas bubbles that subsequently lodge in the vasculature. This technique, known as acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) has been shown to successfully reduce blood flow in vivo, but for in situ conditions where attenuation is present, lower acoustic frequency and ADV threshold may be desirable. Thus, two methods to lower the ADV threshold at a lower 1.44 MHz were explored. The first part of this study investigated the role of pulse duration on ADV. The second part investigated the role of inertial cavitation (IC) external to a droplet by lowering the IC threshold in the host liquid with the presence of Definity contrast agent (CA). The threshold was found to be 5.5-5.9 MPa for short microsecond pulses and decreased for millisecond pulses (3.8-4.6 MPa). When CAs were present and long millisecond pulses were used, the ADV threshold decreased to values as low as 0.41 MPa.},

@article{Lushi2014a,
abstract = {Concentrated suspensions of swimming microorganisms and other forms of active matter are known to display complex, self-organized spatiotemporal patterns on scales that are large compared with those of the individual motile units. Despite intensive experimental and theoretical study, it has remained unclear the extent to which the hydrodynamic flows generated by swimming cells, rather than purely steric interactions between them, drive the self-organization. Here we use the recent discovery of a spiral-vortex state in confined suspensions of Bacillus subtilis to study this issue in detail. Those experiments showed that if the radius of confinement in a thin cylindrical chamber is below a critical value, the suspension will spontaneously form a steady single-vortex state encircled by a counter-rotating cell boundary layer, with spiral cell orientation within the vortex. Left unclear, however, was the flagellar orientation, and hence the cell swimming direction, within the spiral vortex. Here, using a fast simulation method that captures oriented cell-cell and cell-fluid interactions in a minimal model of discrete particle systems, we predict the striking, counterintuitive result that in the presence of collectively generated fluid motion, the cells within the spiral vortex actually swim upstream against those flows. This prediction is then confirmed by the experiments reported here, which include measurements of flagella bundle orientation and cell tracking in the self-organized state. These results highlight the complex interplay between cell orientation and hydrodynamic flows in concentrated suspensions of microorganisms.},

abstract = {Many physicists think that the maximum entropy formalism is a straightforward application of Bayesian statistical ideas to statistical mechanics. Some even say that statistical mechanics is just the general Bayesian logic of inductive inference applied to large mechanical systems. This approach identifies thermodynamic entropy with the information-theoretic uncertainty of an (ideal) observer's subjective distribution over a system's microstates. In this brief note, I show that this postulate, plus the standard Bayesian procedure for updating probabilities, implies that the entropy of a classical system is monotonically non-increasing on the average -- the Bayesian statistical mechanic's arrow of time points backwards. Avoiding this unphysical conclusion requires rejecting the ordinary equations of motion, or practicing an incoherent form of statistical inference, or rejecting the identification of uncertainty and thermodynamic entropy.},

Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.},

abstract = {The issue of determining the best perturbation which results in optimal chaotic flux across a separatrix is addressed, using the Melnikov function and lobe dynamics. This theoretical analysis is motivated mainly through micro-fluidic devices for which this problem has become important recently. Both two- and three-dimensional flows are analysed. Utilising a Fourier transform representation, the nature of the perturbation which maximises this flux for each frequency value is obtained. The resulting optimally attainable flux is computed. A concise bound on this flux is presented in terms of the supremum norm of the normal component of the perturbing velocity, and the size of the heteroclinic manifold. In this instance where the spatial part of the perturbation is permitted to be chosen based on the frequency, it is shown that greater flux is achievable for smaller frequencies. The theory is illustrated through two examples. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Recent developments in nucleation theory, which include hydrodynamic and diffusion constraints, gas phase nonidealities, and heterogeneous nucleation are discussed. A large number of the measured limits of superheat of pure components are close to 88 to 90{\%} of the critical temperature. Where calculations can be made, these measurements are in agreement with predictions from classical nucleation theory. Measurements of the limits of superheat of mixtures are useful for understanding one proposed mechanism for the dangerous phenomena known as contact vapor explosions.},

abstract = {Multivariate curve resolution (MCR) has been applied to separate pure spectra and pure decay profiles of DOSY NMR data. Given good initial guesses of the pure decay profiles, and combined with the nonlinear least square regression (NLR), MCR can result in good separation of the pure components. Nevertheless, due to the presence of artefacts in experimental data, validation of a MCR model is still necessary. In this paper, the covariance matrix of the residuals (CMR), obtained by postmultiplying the residual matrix with its transpose, is proposed to evaluate the quality of the results of an experimental data set. Plots of the rows of this matrix give a general impression of the covariance in the frequency domain of the residual matrix. Different patterns in the plot indicate possible causes of experimental imperfections. This new criterion can be used as diagnosis in order to improve experimental settings as well as suggest appropriate preprocessing of DOSY NMR data. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Such approaches, although a part of the AI canon, are rarely used in research aimed at creating artificial general intelligence. This paper explores the prospects of using in silicoartificial evolution to develop machine consciousness, or strong AI. It is possible that artificial evolution and situated self-organizing agents could become viable tools for studying machine consciousness, but there are several issues that must be overcome. One problem is the use of exogenous selection methods to drive artificial evolutionary processes. A second problem relates to agent representation that is inconsistent with the environment in which the agents are situated. These issues limit the potential for open-ended evolution and fine-grained fitting of agents to environment, which are likely to be important for the eventual development of situated artificial consciousness.},

The goal is to build methods which can also be used for the integration of nonlinear problems if they are previously linearized. The equations are solved using an iterative method on a fixed mesh with the constraint that at each iteration one can only use results obtained in previous iterations on that fixed mesh. On the other hand, this problem requires the numerical integration of matrix Riccati differential equations whose exact solution is a symmetric positive definite time-dependent matrix which controls the stability of the equation for the state. This property is not preserved, in general, by the numerical methods. We analyze how to build methods for the linear problem taking into account the previous constraints, and we propose second order exponential methods based on the Magnus series expansion which unconditionally preserve positivity for this problem and analyze higher order Magnus integrators. The performance of the algorithms is illustrated with the stabilization of a quadrotor which is an unmanned aerial vehicle. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This study was motivated by gas embolotherapy, a developmental cancer treatment in which gas microbubbles that are selectively formed by acoustically vaporizing liquid droplets in vivo are used to occlude tumor blood flow. The evolution of microbubbles formed by acoustic droplet vaporization was analyzed and a four-stage empirical curve was fit to the growth. Viscous resistance from the tube was shown to dampen oscillations of the microbubbles even though the bubble diameter was smaller than the tube diameter. The results suggest that, for some parameter values, vaporization may still be occurring when the bubble expansion starts and indicate the importance of this in modeling the growth of bubbles formed by acoustic droplet vaporization.},

Two important statistical properties of the scalar are the variance, sigma(2) {\textless} T-2 {\textgreater}, and the entropy production, chi = kappa {\textless}vertical bar del T vertical bar(2){\textgreater}. Here {\textless}{\textgreater} denotes a space-time average and kappa is the molecular diffusivity of T. Using variational methods we show that the system must lie above a parabola in the (chi, sigma(2))-plane. The location of the bounding parabola depends on the structure of the velocity and the source. To test the bound, we consider a large-scale source and three two-dimensional model velocities: a uniform steady flow; a statistically homogeneous and isotropic flow characterized by an effective diffusivity; a time-periodic model of oscillating convection cells with chaotic Lagrangian trajectories. Analytic solution of the first example shows that the bound is sharp and realizable. Numerical simulation of the other examples shows that the statistics of T(x, t) lie close to the parabolic frontier in the (chi, sigma(2))-plane. Moreover in the homogenization limit, in which the largest scale in the velocity field is much less than the scale of the source, the results of the simulation limit to the bounding parabola.},

We have obtained closed-form expressions for maximally efficient erasure cycles for deletion of a classical bit of information stored by the position of a particle diffusing in a double-well potential. We find that the extra dissipation beyond the Landauer bound is proportional to the square of the Hellinger distance between the initial and final states divided by the cycle duration, which quantifies how far out of equilibrium the system is driven. Finally, we demonstrate close agreement between the exact optimal cycle and the protocol found using a linear response framework.},

abstract = {A numerical algorithm is described which, it is believed, can accurately model the dynamics of a two-dimensional, inviscid, incompressible fluid with unparalled spatial resolution. The fluid is assumed, however, to be divided into regions of uniform vorticity, conservation of vorticity ensuring that this remains true for all time. Like contour dynamics, the algorithm is concerned with following the evolution of the boundaries of vorticity discontinuity (contours). Unlike contour dynamics, the algorithm automatically removes vorticity features smaller than a predefined scale. For example, two contours enclosing the same uniform vorticity merge into one if they are close enough together. Also, the curvature along a contour is not allowed to exceed the inverse of the cutoff scale. At present, calculations with contour surgery resolve fluid motions extending over four to five orders of magnitude of scales (13 to 20 octaves). Such high-resolution pictures of two-dimensional vortex dynamics have been facilitated by and indeed depend critically upon a nonlocal adaptive node adjustment scheme, and a variety of tests quantify the accuracy of the technique. ?? 1988.},

@article{Majda1999,
abstract = {Several simple mathematical models for the turbulent diffusion of a passive scalar field are developed here with an emphasis on the symbiotic interaction between rigorous mathematical theory (including exact solutions), physical intuition, and numerical simulations. The homogenization theory for periodic velocity fields and random velocity fields with short-range correlations is presented and utilized to examine subtle ways in which the flow geometry can influence the large-scale effective scalar diffusivity. Various forms of anomalous diffusion are then illustrated in some exactly solvable random velocity field models with long-range correlations similar to those present in fully developed turbulence. Here both random shear layer models with special geometry but general correlation structure as well as isotropic rapidly decorrelating models are emphasized. Some of the issues studied in detail in these models are superdiffusive and subdiffusive transport, pair dispersion, fractal dimensions of scalar interfaces, spectral scaling regimes, small-scale and large-scale scalar intermittency, and qualitative behavior over finite time intervals. Finally, it is demonstrated how exactly solvable models can be applied to test and design numerical simulation strategies and theoretical closure approximations for turbulent diffusion.},

@article{Persson2004,
abstract = {Creating amesh is the first step in a wide range of applications, including scientific comput- ing and computer graphics. An unstructured simplex mesh requires a choice of meshpoints (vertex nodes) and a triangulation. We want to offer a short and simple Matlab code, described in more detail than usual, so the reader can experiment (and add to the code) knowing the underlying principles. We find the node locations by solving for equilibrium in a truss structure (using piecewise linear force-displacement relations) and reset the topol- ogy by the Delaunay algorithm. The geometry is described implicitly by its distance function. In addition to being much shorter and simpler than other meshing techniques, our algorithm typically pro- duces meshes of very high quality. We discuss ways to improve the robustness and the performance, but our aim here is simplicity. Readers can download (and edit) the codes from http://math.mit.edu/˜persson/mesh.},

abstract = {The relaxation of a smooth two-dimensional vortex to axisymmetry, also known as ‘axisymmetrization', is studied asymptotically and numerically. The vortex is perturbed at t=0 and differential rotation leads to the wind-up of vorticity fluctuations to form a spiral. It is shown that for infinite Reynolds number and in the linear approximation, the vorticity distribution tends to axisymmetry in a weak or coarse-grained sense: when the vorticity field is integrated against a smooth test function the result decays asymptotically as t−$\lambda$ with $\lambda$=1+(n2+8)1/2, where n is the azimuthal wavenumber of the perturbation and n[gt-or-equal, slanted]1. The far-field stream function of the perturbation decays with the same exponent. To obtain these results the paper develops a complete asymptotic picture of the linear evolution of vorticity fluctuations for large times t, which is based on that of Lundgren (1982).},

@article{Boyland2000,
abstract = {A new approach to regular and chaotic fluid advection is presented that utilizes the Thurston–Nielsen classification theorem. The prototypical two-dimensional problem of stirring by a finite number of stirrers confined to a disk of fluid is considered. The theory shows that for particular ‘stirring protocols' a significant increase in complexity of the stirred motion – known as topological chaos – occurs when three or more stirrers are present and are moved about in certain ways. In this sense prior studies of chaotic advection with at most two stirrers, that were, furthermore, usually fixed in place and simply rotated about their axes, have been ‘too simple'. We set out the basic theory without proofs and demonstrate the applicability of several topological concepts to fluid stirring. A key role is played by the representation of a given stirring protocol as a braid in a (2+1)-dimensional space–time made up of the flow plane and a time axis perpendicular to it. A simple experiment in which a viscous liquid is stirred by three stirrers has been conducted and is used to illustrate the theory.},
